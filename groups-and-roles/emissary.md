# The Emissary Program
The emissary program is designed to allow third party entities to raise fleets for LinkNet members without the need of a permanent [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements) with the community.

All emissary based content and fleets should be raised inside our systems and use our communication channels. This program is not to advertise your corporation but to advertise your content. For corporation advertisement see the [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements) program

## Requirements
In order to apply to the emissary program you will need to have at least one player who is going to be responsible for communicating and coordinating things with our community. This player is most often the CEO, director or a fleet commander of your corporation. This player will be granted the Emissary role while the rest of the corporation members will gain the emissary partner state which allows them to access our channels.

## Benefits
The emissary program is the easiest way to start interacting with LinkNet without a [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements). With the emissary program you will be given the required roles in our systems to share the required information needed for players to find out about your fleets or content.
- No need for a partnership
- Instant setup
- Free platform to advertise your content
- An easy way to reach out for tons of players

## Applying
1. Register on our [AUTH](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/) as a guest state user with a public scope.
1. Apply for the emissary role on our AUTH [group](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/groups/) section. This role is only visible for users with the guest state.
1. Activate your account on our [discord](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/tools/communication/discord)
1. Contact **Ikarus Cesaille** on our discord and provide required information for us to check that you match the requirements for the program

# Emissary Program Tools
You have two important tools given for you when you are accepted for the emissary program. These tools are used to share information for our memberbase about your content.

## Operations Calendar
The [operations calendar](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/opcalendar/) inculdes all the needed information for players to know about events and fleets that are scheduled to happen.

To schedule fleets on the operation calendar please see the guide in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#scheduling-fleets).

## Discord fleet pings
Once your fleet is about to go live you should ping it on our discord. In order to send out pings you will need to use the [fleet ping tool](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/fleetpings/) located on our AUTH.

> Note that we have a strict ping policy rule that that prohibits global pings such as @here or @everyone to be sent unless the operation qualifies as STRATOP or CTA to prevent *ping exhaustion*. Use the special interest groups to ping at the targeted players related to type of your content.

The guide for creating pings on our discord is located in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#discord-fleet-pings).

## Fleets and comms
When you raise your fleet you should be using one of the discord channels located on our discord. You may either use the public channels or the community restricted channels depending on the access type you want to host for your fleet.

To invite memers in the fleet please post the fleet in `LinkNet General` ingame channel or use the new fleet up tool to open up the fleet with public access. 

Use require accept if needed for members to join the fleet if the fleet is restricted only for LinkNet members or set up personal standings for them to be able to join the fleet. The list of our corporations is located in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/coalition-corporations).
