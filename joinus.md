# Joining us as a player
The silent coalition community offers you different corporations based on you needs and language. While some of the corporations have public open recruitment and allow pretty much anyone to join them, some of the corporations only recruit from within the other coalition corporations.

## Entry Corporations
These corporations serves as the entry level corporation for the coalition and as the feeder corporation for other corporations both inside and outside of the coalition. While in a entry corporation you have no mandatory operations or required play hours, you can simply play the game as you wish to play it.

If you want you can participate in cross corporation operations in different areas of space taking part in PVE, PVP, mining and industry in all security areas. This way you are able to get a sneak peak of what different activities looks like without the need of dedicating yourself right away by joining a new corporation.

If you wish not to take part in any fleet or group activities then that is your right as well. If you choose so you can simply use the emtry corporations and SiCO as a social corporation and keep on with your solo activities.

> There are no mandatory tasks required from you while you are in the entry corporations

Our ultimate goal is to find you a corporation that matches your personal goals and gameplay needs in EVE. While we do have several corporations within the coalition doing different things there might be situations when we simply canâ€™t provide the perfect corporation for your personal needs within the coalition. In situations like this we try to guide you towards corporations and entities that are not part of the coalition that we think would work out for you. We hold no political stances against any entities so we are completely neutral in our guidance.

## Joining an entry corporation

Any player in EVE can join us if they agree on our simple rules located in here: [Coalition rules](/community/rules). If you are an friendly and mature player you will be good to go!

## Language options
These corporations are our recommended language partners that we offer for players that do not wish or can't operate in Enlish speaking corporations. 

While these corporations may not be interacting with the rest of the coalition due to language barriers and possible geo-blocking we have verified that they will take good care of you once you join them!

The default entry corporations are english speaking only. If you are looking for corporations within the coalition that do not communicate in english have a look at the following channels:

- For russian corporations join channel `Sico Public RU`
- For chinese corporations join channel `Sico Public ZH`
