# ![sico-logo-512x512.png](/sico-logo-512x512.png =32x) EVE LinkNet wiki
Welcome to the public EVE LinkNet community wiki.

The EVE LinkNet is a non-profit community program that connects the right players with the right corporations. Our mission is to make sure that no pilots are lost into the abyss because of lacking the right wing mans from their side.

This wiki contains information that is relevant for operations for community pilots.
Guides found on this site are not extensive and do not cover every aspect of the given content. For more extensive guides we recommend that you have a look at places such https://wiki.eveuniversity.org

Our guides will get you started with certain content but in order to try to keep all of our information up to date we only include the basic information.
