# General Rookie Introduction Program [GRIP]
GRIP is a program that is aimed at teaching new and old players the basics of the different career options in EVE Online. The goal of this program is to provide the needed information for players who have no prior experiment in the career in question to get started to work on the career path as an full time option.

GRIP is constructed from three different sections. Each section explains the basics of the given career option but does not go into advanced details. Explanations in GRIP should only to be given to a degree where the player can then continue their choosen career option independently.

## GRIP Content
The following sections should be covered in a GRIP fleet:

### Preparations
The players should be explained the basic things they need to do in order to take part in the GRIP. These steps should be limited only to the nessessary ones so that the player can then complete their role in the GRIP fleet. Steps should be explained in a simple way that can be understod by fresh new players. The preparation steps can contain things such as:

- Needed skills
- Needed ships
- Needed security standing
- Understanding of how to find flets
- Setting up needed IT systems such as comms

### Class
After the needed preparation steps have been completed by the players looking to attend the GRIP (mainly independently) follows the class part. In this class session the fleet commander who is running the GRIP should explain the basic theory that is going to be put in practise in the fleet part.

The theory explained in this class section should similar to preparations cover only the basics so that the playeres attending GRIP will understand what to do in the fleet. Some examples about the things explained in the class should cover:

- Goal of the GRIP content
- How to execute the content in GRIP such as
	- How to gank
  - How to mine
  - How to fleet up
  - How to change your clones
  - How to have needed security standings
- Dangers of practising said content
- Downsides of practising said content

### Fleet
Once basics of the GRIP content has been explained the freshly learned knowledge should be put in practise in a fleet enviroment. During this fleet you should aim to do the things that you discussed earlier in the class part.

## Goal of the GRIP
Once you have executed a GRIP fleet you should educate the participants of how to get deeper in the career that the GRIP was all about. This can be done by:
- Advertising SIGS
- Advertising corps operating around the career area
- Advertising third party entities such as NPIS
