## Life in -BONK
-BONK characters are really good only for one thing, which is going full murderhobo. We have several different ways to go about this be it solo small stuff or big freightor ganks. Your characters in -BONK will end up on numerous lists and become hated by most people around you HOW FUN!

You will be able to pick up ships from the corporation  hangar in any number of our staging systems and gank any player who is not blue to us. The primary goal is to see exactly how much you can burn down around you and even make a profit off of :)
