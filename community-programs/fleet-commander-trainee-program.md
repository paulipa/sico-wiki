The training program for new fleet commanders aim to help pilots with little or no fleet commander background to get started with their fleet commander training and raising fleet. For this we have a tutor program where you will be assigned an experienced FC that will guide you and be your point of contact for any fleet commander related questions you might have.

## Joining the program

When you apply to the FC trainee group on AUTH you will be contacted by a fleet commander that will make sure that you understand what you are getting into. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have any fleet commander experience or are an experienced fleet commander. All of our new FC trainees will to thorough the same procedure.

To get started with your training simply apply to the group and wait someone to contact you over discord.

## Get started with your training

Once you have been accepted to the group and assigned a tutor you can start learning how to FC. The easiest way to do this is jump right away into fleet commanding. If you have no experience in fleet commanding you might want to backseat and join another fleet so that you get an idea what fleet commanding is all about.

**The best way to get started is to take out a MQP fleet**. While these fleet aim to teach new pilots the very basics of fleet flying they are a perfect place for a fleet commander trainee to learn how to command fleets! The fleets are very cheap, full of pilots interested in learning and very agile.

**Talk with your mentor and see when he might be able to backseat you for a MQP fleet**. If you are unable to work out a schedule you can ask any fleet commander, ceo or wing director on the command center channel to backseat you.

Take out your first MQP fleet. **Do not worry if things go slow and you have to refer all the time to the fleet commander checklist** for MQP fleets. After you have ran the MQP fleets a few times you will start to remember all the basics without the need to have a look at the checklist details.

[**The checklist**](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/groups-and-roles/fc-mqp-checklist) **is there to help you out to make sure you don’t miss anything so take advantage of it.**

**Do not fear to lose your fleet**. In fact it is preferred to lose a MQP fleet rather than brining it home alive! The coalition offers full SRP for all MQP fleets so there is no need to worry about money. Be bold with engaging on hostiles you find and learn from your mistakes. Making mistakes is the only way to learn about when you can take a fight and when you can’t.

## For mentors

Any experienced and active fleet commander, ceo or wing director with fleet commanding experience can act as a mentor for a new player.

If you are a mentor you can look up for people applying to the fleet commander trainee position in here [https://auth.silentcoalition.com/group/management/](https://auth.silentcoalition.com/group/management/)

**You can take as many trainees as you feel comfortable with**. For now I recommend starting with 3 or 4 max so that you do not overwhelm yourself.

**Contact the player on discord and make sure they know what they are applying for**. Ask what their time zone is and if it doesn’t match with your time zone ping other commanders on the command center to let them know that a player in a sed time zone is looking for a mentor.

**If your time zones are a match and the player seems to be good material for the trainee progra**m you can accept them into the group by accepting their application on the group management page.

Talk with your young padawan and try to set up a MQP fleet with them. If they are comfortable to jump right into the lead and run the fleet act as a back seater for them and make sure they cover all MQP basics. If they do not have any fleet experience run a MQP fleet as them as a backseat for you.

**Pretty much when your trainee has flown in 1 or 2 MQP fleets they are all set to run them their selves**. The first time will always be scary and the trainee might miss thigs from the checklist. Help them out by adding more information to the MQP fleet if they miss things but try not to take lead of the fleet no matter how shitty it goes! The more they explode the more they learn.
