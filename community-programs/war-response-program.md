> The Dark Arts are many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.
—Description of the Dark Arts

# HS War Response Program
Welcome to Defence Against the Dark Arts. **This corporation is the primary fast response military corporation for the LinkNet community.** While its members are mainly alpha alt (alternative) characters with low skill points and very narrow skills to only fly the current doctrines, it may also be joined with older or omega accounts.

> The primary purpose for this corporation is to serve as a response fleet for the initial aggressions against our structures or allies.
{.is-info}

**The characters on default in the corporation are alt characters in alpha state.** The idea behind this is that anyone in the community is able to make a new alpha character and help us in our war efforts to protect the assets we have without the need to dangering their main character or the need to move around in space.

> We encourage all of our members to make new alpha accounts to this corporation. You will be able to keep the skills training even if you would not actively log in to your war alt and have an character ready for combat at all times.
{.is-success}

## Creating a new alpha account with buddy invite
The whole process of joining and creating a new charactser to SLTRN is based on the buddy invite. When you create a new character with an buddy invite you get a massive 1 000 000 free skill points to inject!

The free SP you get is enough for you to inject to the entry version of our primary doctrine. This means that you do not have to spend a second training for the skills or logging in to train for the skills for the SLTRN entry doctrines.

> Please follow the following steps for creating your SLTRN character
{.is-info}

1. Use a buddy invite of your own by making on in [here](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit) or alternatively you can use the [buddy invite created by us](https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=dbb7443d-c7b0-4133-92ce-58d6165c71bd)
1. Create a new account and activate it.
1. Next you want to create a **caldari character**. This will save you some skill points.
1. OPTIONAL: Since we want to have a tiny bit or RP in this corporation please pick a Harry Potter series themed name. You can create variations of the names if the name you are looking for is not available but try to keep it somehow related. This way when our horde of wizards enters locals space people will know shit is going down! You can use this list for help https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters
1. Make an ingame application to the Defence Against the Dark Arts [SLTRN] corporation. Use the search bar on the top left corner as this corporation does not have an advert up in the corporation finder tool.
7. Link your SLTRN alt with your main character by pressing on the [add character button](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/account/characters/add/) on AUTH dashboard.

> Without adding your SLTRN character on AUTH under your main account you won't be able to see the discord channel for this corporation and will not see the pings for their operations. Updating the group after addind the character may take up to one hour.
{.is-warning}

You have now created your new SLTRN character! Next we will be injecting the needed skills with the free SP we got from the buddy invite

# Injecting Doctrine Skills
The following section will explain you how to inject to the required skills to fly our entry level doctrinre. You will be injecting to: Ferox, Naga and Osprey fittings.

## Full Plan, Ferox & Osprey Alpha
1. The first thing that you need to do is to obviously to redeem the free skill points. Open your redeem item windows and redeem the civilian skill point pack! You now have 1 000 000 free skill points that you can inject.
![redeem_items.jpg](/redeem_items.jpg =500x)
1. Ask in the `EVE LinkNet partners` channel ingame or on our discord for an officer to send you 15 mil isk. You will need this to buy the needed skill books.
1. Next open the corporation chat window and look for the skill plans. Open up the Full Plan, Ferox & Osprey Alpha
![sltrn-full-plan.jpg](/sltrn-full-plan.jpg =400x)
1. After you open the plan you will notice that you are not able to start the plan just yet. This is due to your character lacking the needed skills. Open up the plan by pressing on the `Show skill plan content` button.
![sltrn-show-plan.jpg](/sltrn-show-plan.jpg =200x)
1. Click on the buy missing skillbooks button
![sltrn-buy-missing-skills.jpg](/sltrn-buy-missing-skills.jpg =400x)
1. After this you will be able to add the skills on your queue by pressing on the `add skills to training queue`. Your training may be on pause on default as the plan might be too long at this point.
![sltrn-skills-bought.jpg](/sltrn-skills-bought.jpg =400x)
1. Open up your skill queue and click on the `apply skill points` this is where you will apply the 1mil of points from the buddy invite to fulfill the base part of the plan.
![sltrn-apply-skillpoints.jpg](/sltrn-apply-skillpoints.jpg =500x)
1. **Start your skill training** and continue training the skills in the plan. The rest of the skills in this plan will improve the performance of the ferox on its own to the absolutely maximum alpha level performance that the ship can be trained for.
![sltrn-skills-in-training.jpg](/sltrn-skills-in-training.jpg =500x)

> You are now able to fly both the alpha ferox and the alpha osprey. Your skills will continue to train and improve the performance of the ferox over time.

# Life in SLTRN
Since the corporation is primarily used as a initial response force for defending our structure or attacking hostile structures there is not much “normal life” while in this corporation. Of course you can do your daily business while in this corporation as long as you remember that this corporation is likely to be at war at all times.

> Without adding your SLTRN character on AUTH under your main account you won't be able to see the discord channel for this corporation and will not see the pings for their operations. Updating the group after addind the character may take up to one hour.
{.is-warning}

## Citadel Gunnery
As a member of SLTRN you have the permissions to man and shoot with most of the coalition citadels. A armed and manned citadel will scare away solo attackers or very small gangs that do not have logistics.

> Your job as a SLTRN member is to man the citadel when they are hit and try to scare away any hostiles.
{.is-success}

## How to man a citadel
When a citadel gets hit you will receive a ping that will inculde information about the citadel under attack. The ping will look like this:
![citadel_alert-800x134.jpg](/citadel_alert-800x134.jpg)

After you know where to go head to the structure and dock up. When you dock up you are able to see the button called take control. This allows you to man the citadel. Press this butto
![take_control-513x400.jpg](/take_control-513x400.jpg)

After you have taken control of the citadel you can use it pretty much like any mormal ship. You will see your modules in the same place as where they are in your ship as well as your shield, capacitor and other information. So now that you have manned the citadel all you need to do is to lock the aggressor and try to kill it.

## Ships
All doctrine ships in SLRTN are given to you for free during deployments. Since all of SLTRN characters can fly both the ferox and the osprey that you injected when you created your characters maintaining doctrines is easy.

> You do not need to spend a penny of your own money while flying in the SLTRN PVP deployments.
{.is-success}

Doctrines will be given out when fleets deploy and we ask you to return your ship once you are done, assuming it doesn’t blow up. If you want to keep on training to T2 versions of the ships (see doctrine T2 ferox) you will need to bring in those fits yourself and require SRP if you blow up.

There even is a fit for omega players who want to invest PLEX on their alts. This Ferox fit includes a command link which will increase the performance of the whole fleet. So it is always a good idea to have links with the fleet if possible.

## Deployments
Time to time SLTRN will execute war deployments. These may be either for structure defending or attacking hostile structures. During deployments you should keep your character (and possible ships) located at the deployment station and have your medical clone set to this station as well.

When we deploy you will get all the relative information in a pinned message on the SLTRN discord channel. You will also see the information about our deployments in the MOTD of the corporation chat

## What to train next
Once you have skilled for the doctrine ships you may have some SP left over to spend. You can also keep on training skills normaly with the skill que. 

We recommend that you keep on training the skills needed to improve the ferox or osprey by aiming towards the t2 fitted version of both ships.

> The T2 variant of the ferox is located in here https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#ferox-fleet

We also recommend that you train some targeting skills as these are extremely important for logi pilots. Here are some of the skills that we recommend you keep on training:

- Signature Analysis
- Long Range Targeting
- Target Management can be very usefull and fast to train to level 3 or 4

Some supporting skills will improve both the ferox and the osprey. Engineering Skills especially Capacitor Skills like:

- Capacitor Management – Capacitor Systems Operation are very useful for both the Ferox AND the Osprey Pure Logi skills, which reduce the Capacitor Cost of the Shield Repairers and the Capacitor Transfer are very usefull too for staying stable over longer periods of time with only 1 incoming cap transfer
- Shield Emission Systems
