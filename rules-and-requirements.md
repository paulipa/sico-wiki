# Goals
The primary goal of the LinkNet program is to create an community where each different type of player are able to enjoy the game and pursuit the goals they have set for them. 

Our other goals are:
- To create a community of players that would have fun and interact with each other’s while playing the game despite their real life divergences.
- To provide a friendly and mature community that respects all types of players despite their in-game orientations.
- To help individual members to find active corporations that suit their personal game play needs in EVE Online
- To help corporations provide content across of the whole coalition and help them pursuit their own goals

# Behaviour and communication rules
As EVE is an addicting and compelling game sometimes the real life ideologies or beliefs easily find their way into the game which may cause clashes between different types of players.

In order to keep our community of thousands of players as a friendly and a nice place to play we have set some ground rules that apply on each member within the partner corporations. With these rules we are trying to keep our focus on EVE and on enjoying the game with players from all over the world with all types of ideologies.

## Banned Topics
**The following topics are banned in all community channels** including but not limited to in-game channels, corporation channel, forums, homepage, discord and any other voice communication programs.
- All racists, sexists, homophobic and topics alike.
- All real life politics, religious topics and sexual orientations.
- All personal attacks, finger pointing or public shaming.
- Pushing/advertising of all personal agendas, ideologies or non community related activites across the community channels to other members without proper approval.

## Prohibited actions against all players
While we do understand that in the heat of a battle you most often want to smack talk a bit. That is completely fine as long as you keep it mature and don’t overshoot. Since EVE is a social game we want to make sure that also the players around us are enjoying the game. For this reason the following rules applies on your general attitude of being nice
- **You are bint by EVE Online EULA** no matter what you do. EULA includes some pretty basic stuff such as: You may not submit any content to any chat room or other public forum within the Game that is harassing, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, libelous or defamatory, encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense or give rise to civil liabilities, or is unlawful in any other way, including without limitation the submission of content that infringes on a third-party’s intellectual property rights.
- **You are prohibited to do personal attacks** against any players in EVE. Smach talk is allowed.

## Prohibited actions against community members
- **Scamming or stealing from any partner corporation members** is not allowed. This includes all types of scams and ninja looting. Scamming players outside our partnered corporations is allowed.

## Alliance Partner | Silent Company
Corporations who want to fly under the banner of the Silent Company alliance and do not seek to take part in any wars may join the Silent Company alliance. Joining the alliance reduces the amount of work required for setting channel access and standings.

> Corporations in the entry level alliance are not allowed to hold any structures under their corporations. The entry level alliance will never be eligible for war. If this rules is broken and a corporation anchors any structures making the alliance venerable for wars the corporation will be removed without any warning. It is the responsibility of the CEO to make sure that regular members are unable to anchor structures.
{.is-danger}

> Corporations in the entry alliance will need to keep the setting to reject all structure transfers on at all times.
{.is-warning}

- Corporation has full autonomy over their own corporation excluding the matters mentioned above.

## Language Partner
Language partner corporations are special case corporations that are loosely connected to the coalition. The purpose of these non English speaking corporations is to provide content for non English speaking players.

> Language partner entities are our partners that we recommend for players who do not wish or can't operate in English. We also advertise these corporations in our general recruitment mails.
{.is-info}

While these corporations may not be interacting with the rest of the coalition due to language barriers and possible geo-blocking we have verified that they will take good care of you once you join them!

In order to qualify as a language partner corporation for SiCO your corporation will need to:

- Corporation needs to have at least 50 active individual members in the corporation
- No standing adjustments is required.
- Corporations main language must be something else than English.
- Corporation needs to be active and have a clear goal in sight. Coalition only interacts with language option corporations that we believe are providing true content and taking care of the members we send to the corporations.
- Corporation needs to have a representative or point of contact towards SiCO who will inform the coalition about any major changes that would effect pushing new recruits to their corporation.
- Corporation needs to provide the coalition a clear and simple advertising phrase in their native language to be used for recruiting purposes on behalf of the coalition.
- Set aside any standing differences or in game political ambitions that your corporation might have when interacting with SiCO members or in any of the SiCO related channels
- Corporation must seek to cooperate with SiCO member corporations whenever possible and suitable based on the corporation goals of the language option corporation
- If most of the corporation members talk English the language option corporation may apply for full member entity status or to join the Silent Company alliance. In these cases the rules applied on the language corporation will change accordingly.

# Changing coalition corporations
Members that are part of any of the coalition corporations are allowed to request a transfer to a different wing if they do wish to change their gameplay. The different wings might have some limitations and requirements of their own so it is always good that have a chat with a director, recruiter or a CEO of the corporation that you seek to join.

Each of the coalition corporations have most often one or two primary focuses. If these focuses align better with your personal interests then it might be a good idea to consider changing your corporation.

You are able to find a list of all of our corporations in here https://www.silentcoalition.com/about-us

> Corporations are not allowed to poach members from other corporations. Make your corporations attractive so that people want to join you to get their hands on the content you are creating for them!
{.is-warning}

# Leadership
**The coalition leadership is formed by each corporation CEO and directors**. Together these players will find the the most optimal solutions for leading our coalition of different types of players and cultures on a general level. All of these players are on the same level and none of them can dictate alone the directions the coalition should take. Official rules and guidelines on the general level of the coalition are decided together and stated on this wiki. 

## Expectations and capabilities
Players holding these roles are expected to behave with dignity and follow the coalition rules and guidelines in all situations, even if it would fight against their personal beliefs. A level of professionalism is expected from these players when acting outside their own corporation channels.

**Players with leadership positions do not have any power over players outside of their own corporation** with matters that do not involve coalition rule or guideline violations.

**These players are expected to use the tools at their hands by keeping the previous sections in mind**. This includes matters of removing content, messages and pages made by other players unless they are direct violations of the coalition rules.

**Players with these roles have the authority over you when it comes to coalition rule violations**. You are bound to listen and follow their orders in such matters.

The chain of command from top to down for the current coalition roles are:
- CEO
- Wing Director
- Diplomats
- Fleet Commander
- Fleet Commander Trainee
- Industrial Commander

# Dealing with rule violations and other problems
> If someone is violating the rules set for the coalition or on your own corporation you are not allowed to take matters into your own hand.
{.is-warning}

**You are allowed to remind the players of the rules of the coalition*** if you see any rule breaking but you are not allowed to escalate and start to debate with the person in question.

**Report all problems and rule breaking to any corporation CEO or the coalition executor**. Keep in mind that you will need to provide proof for your report, in most often in a form of chat logs. The leadership will deal with any and all of the problems raised and it is not the job of a line member to govern the coalition.

# Identifying and contacting leadership
To contact leadership you can ping `@ceo` or `@wing director` on any of the discord channels. You will be able to see all players holding coalition positions on the right side of the discord channel, ordered in the same chain of command order as is mentioned in the rules.

You can also send personal messages via discord or by in-game mail to any of these players.
