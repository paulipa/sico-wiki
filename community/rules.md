The most important goal of the coalition is to create an environment where each different type of player are able to enjoy the game and pursuit the goals they have set for them.

As EVE is an addicting and compelling game sometimes the real life ideologies or beliefs easily find their way into the game which may cause clashes between different types of players.

# Constitution Rules of SiCO
In order to keep our coalition of thousands of players as a friendly and a nice place to play we have set some ground rules that apply on each member within the coalition corporations. With these rules we are trying to keep our focus on EVE and on enjoying the game with players from all over the world with all types of ideologies.

## Coalition main goals
- To create a community of players that would have fun and interact with each other’s while playing the game despite their real life divergences.
- To provide a friendly and mature community that respects all types of players despite their in-game orientations.
- To help individual members to find active corporations that suit their personal game play needs in EVE Online
- To help corporations provide content across of the whole coalition and help them pursuit their own goals

## Banned Topics
**The following topics are banned in all coalition channels** including but not limited to in-game channels, corporation channel, forums, homepage, discord and any other voice communication programs.
- All racists, sexists, homophobic and topics alike.
- All real life politics, religious topics and sexual orientations.
- All personal attacks, finger pointing or public shaming.
- Pushing/advertising of all personal agendas, ideologies or non sico related communities across coalition channels to other members such as CSM campaigns without coalition approval

## Prohibited ingame actions against other coalition members
- **Scamming or stealing from coalition members** is not allowed. This includes all types of scams and ninja looting. Scamming players outside our coalition is legit taken that the rules of your current corporation do not prevent doing it.
- **Spamming any communication channels with repeating content** such as advertising your contracts on sale every hour. This also applies on pushing your own agendas or advertising non SiCO related communities.
- **Linking HyperNet Relay offers in any of the global channels** or sending them via corporation/alliance mail is not allowed.
- **Shooting or killing any coalition members with blue standings** outside coalition raised PvP events is not allowed. If a coalition member intentionally opens fire against you then you are allowed to defend yourself.
- **Ganking coalition members or providing possible locations** for third party gankers. You are allowed to gank players outside the coalition taken that your current corporation rules do not prohibit you from doing this.
- **Unfriendly or immature attitudes against all coalition members** are not allowed. These actions are allowed against non coalition members on a healthy level in terms of salt mining in local and poking people for a fight.
- **Begging for money or items** intentionally and repeatedly.

## Prohibited actions against players outside the coalition
While we do understand that in the heat of a battle you most often want to smack talk a bit. That is completely fine as long as you keep it mature and don’t overshoot. Since EVE is a social game we want to make sure that also the players around us are enjoying the game. For this reason the following rules applies on your general attitude of being nice

- **You are bint by EVE Online EULA** no matter what you do. EULA includes some pretty basic stuff such as: You may not submit any content to any chat room or other public forum within the Game that is harassing, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, libelous or defamatory, encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense or give rise to civil liabilities, or is unlawful in any other way, including without limitation the submission of content that infringes on a third-party’s intellectual property rights.
- **You are prohibited to do personal attacks** on players outside the coalition in terms of communications. You may gank them but always be polite about it!
- **No toxic behavior** in any situations
- **All real life threats** are taken extremely serious by CCP and will get you permanently banned rather easy. Keep your head cool as you don’t want to lose your characters for yelling someone to choke on a bag of dicks.

## Requirements for all coalition members
- **Communicate in english** when talking or typing in any of our public or coalition restricted text or voice channels.
- **SC Comms channel for all general chattering**. All of the corporations that belongs to SiCO are using the custom in-game channel called SC Comms for all of their general chattering. The different corporations may be using their own chat channels for sensitive information such as null sec events or language restricted chattering, but all of the general chattering should be kept in SC Comms.
- **Registering on AUTH is mandatory** for all coalition members. The AUTH programs are used to manage player access to coalition restricted content such as the homepage content and discord rooms.
- **Seek to help out other coalition entities** whenever possible.
- **No hostile actions against any strategic structures or systems** regarless of standing settings.

# Requirements for coalition corporations
The coalition corporations may have different requirements set on them depending on if they belong to the coalition entry level alliance or if they are a full member corporation of the coalition.

**Both full member and entry level alliance member corporations have the same benefits and services** in use for their needs as well as the same access to systems and services. The main difference between these two comes from the side of system management.

## Full Coalition Member Corporation Requirements
These corporations are not added to the alliance. Instead they will be linked to other corporations with standings. They will use the general communication channels the same way normal alliances use the alliance channell.

- Corporation needs to have at least 30 active individual members in the corporation
- Corporation needs to update each coalition standing change on corporation level and keep the standings updated
- Corporation must have a clear goal and preferably a unique goal for their corporation compared to other coalition corporations.
- Corporation must keep an updated corp description page on the homepage for their corporation. This is the advertisement and information page for coalition members who seek to join your corporation.
- Corporation can decide on their own if they want to hold structures under their own corporation (to be war eligible or not).
- Corporation has full autonomy over themselves including the ability to join an alliance in EVE. Only the corporation that is a full member corporation will be part of SiCO and the other alliance members the corporation has joined will be treated as neutral entities.
- All members needs to be registered on AUTH and have activated the discord service. You may use your own services in addition to coalition AUTH. Coalition AUTH only requires public scope from line members.
- Corporation leadership must be active and interact with other coalition leadership.
- Corporation should provide content for other coalition members whenever possible by opening their fleets and services for them. This is the best way to show other members what your corporation is doing and advertise your corporation for those who seek the game play type your corporation is participating in.
- Set aside any standing differences or in game political ambitions that your corporation might be inheriting from your alliance or mega coalition when interacting with other coalition members. For example you are not allowed to underrate coalition corporations that are part of your rival alliances. SiCO only operates on corporation level.

## Silent Company | High Sec non war eligible alliance
Corporations who want to fly under the banner of the Silent Company alliance and do not seek to take part in any wars may join the Silent Company alliance. Joining the alliance reduces the amount of work required for setting channel access and standings.

> Corporations in the entry level alliance are not allowed to hold any structures under their corporations. The entry level alliance will never be eligible for war. If this rules is broken and a corporation anchors any structures making the alliance venerable for wars the corporation will be removed without any warning. It is the responsibility of the CEO to make sure that regular members are unable to anchor structures.
{.is-danger}

> Corporations in the entry alliance will need to keep the setting to reject all structure transfers on at all times.
{.is-warning}

- Corporation needs to have at least 30 active individual members in the corporation
- All members needs to be registered on AUTH and have activated the discord service. You may use your own services in addition to coalition AUTH. Coalition AUTH only requires public scope from line members.
- The alliance will manage all standings and service accesses on behalf of the corporation. If the corporation leaves the alliance they are treated as a neutral entity and will lose access to the services.
- Corporation may request to become a full member corporation if they meet the requirements or are looking to join another alliance that requires by game mechanisms for the corporation to leave the entry level alliance.
- Corporation should provide content for other coalition members whenever possible by opening their fleets and services for them. This is the best way to show other members what your corporation is doing and advertise your corporation for those who seek the game play type your corporation is participating in.
- Corporation has full autonomy over their own corporation excluding the matters mentioned above.

## Language partner corporations
Language partner corporations are special case corporations that are loosely connected to the coalition. The purpose of these non English speaking corporations is to provide content for non English speaking players.

These corporations are our recommended language partners that we offer for players who do not wish or can't operate in Enlish. We also advertise these corporations in our general recruitment mails.

While these corporations may not be interacting with the rest of the coalition due to language barriers and possible geo-blocking we have verified that they will take good care of you once you join them!

In order to qualify as a language partner corporation for SiCO your corporation will need to:

- Corporation needs to have at least 30 active individual members in the corporation
- Corporations main language must be something else than English.
- Corporation needs to be active and have a clear goal in sight. Coalition only interacts with language option corporations that we believe are providing true content and taking care of the members we send to the corporations.
- Corporation needs to have a representative or point of contact towards SiCO who will inform the coalition about any major changes that would effect pushing new recruits to their corporation.
- Corporation needs to provide the coalition a clear and simple advertising phrase in their native language to be used for recruiting purposes on behalf of the coalition.
- Set aside any standing differences or in game political ambitions that your corporation might have when interacting with SiCO members or in any of the SiCO related channels
- Corporation must seek to cooperate with SiCO member corporations whenever possible and suitable based on the corporation goals of the language option corporation
- If most of the corporation members talk English the language option corporation may apply for full coalition corporation status or to join the Silent Company alliance. In these cases the rules applied on the language corporation will change accordingly.

# Changing coalition corporations
Members that are part of any of the coalition corporations are allowed to request a transfer to a different wing if they do wish to change their gameplay. The different wings might have some limitations and requirements of their own so it is always good that have a chat with a director, recruiter or a CEO of the corporation that you seek to join.

Each of the coalition corporations have most often one or two primary focuses. If these focuses align better with your personal interests then it might be a good idea to consider changing your corporation.

You are able to find a list of all of our corporations in here https://www.silentcoalition.com/about-us

> Corporations are not allowed to poach members from other corporations. Make your corporations attractive so that people want to join you to get their hands on the content you are creating for them!

# Leadership
**The coalition leadership is formed by each corporation CEO and directors**. Together these players will find the the most optimal solutions for leading our coalition of different types of players and cultures on a general level. All of these players are on the same level and none of them can dictate alone the directions the coalition should take. Official rules and guidelines on the general level of the coalition are decided together and stated on this wiki. 

## Expectations and capabilities
Players holding these roles are expected to behave with dignity and follow the coalition rules and guidelines in all situations, even if it would fight against their personal beliefs. A level of professionalism is expected from these players when acting outside their own corporation channels.

**Players with leadership positions do not have any power over players outside of their own corporation** with matters that do not involve coalition rule or guideline violations.

**These players are expected to use the tools at their hands by keeping the previous sections in mind**. This includes matters of removing content, messages and pages made by other players unless they are direct violations of the coalition rules.

**Players with these roles have the authority over you when it comes to coalition rule violations**. You are bound to listen and follow their orders in such matters.

The chain of command from top to down for the current coalition roles are:
- CEO
- Wing Director
- Diplomats
- Fleet Commander
- Fleet Commander Trainee
- Industrial Commander

# Dealing with round violations and problems
> If someone is violating the rules set for the coalition or on your own corporation you are not allowed to take matters into your own hand.
{.is-warning}

**You are allowed to remind the players of the rules of the coalition*** if you see any rule breaking but you are not allowed to escalate and start to debate with the person in question.

**Report all problems and rule breaking to any corporation CEO or the coalition executor**. Keep in mind that you will need to provide proof for your report, in most often in a form of chat logs. The leadership will deal with any and all of the problems raised and it is not the job of a line member to govern the coalition.

# Identifying and contacting leadership
To contact leadership you can ping `@ceo` or `@wing director` on any of the discord channels. You will be able to see all players holding coalition positions on the right side of the discord channel, ordered in the same chain of command order as is mentioned in the rules.

You can also send personal messages via discord or by in-game mail to any of these players.
