This section includes information about all of our partner corporations. This page is aimed at making it easier for you to find the right corporation for your personal needs in EVE.

# Entry Corporations
LinkNet entry level corporations are open corporations that anyone can join without any requirements. Joining these corporations allows you to access all of our community services, channels and events. You will be able to advance to more focused community partner corporations via the entry level corporations or remain in the entry corporation to enjoy the social aspect of them.

The entry corporations are open corporations that you can join by simply clicking on the apply to join button. No interview or APIs required!

> Almost all of our partner corporations will recruit their members from within the entry level corporations. By joining the entry corporations you will gain access to all of the community content including content from other partners.
