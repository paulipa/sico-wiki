# Tama Gate Camp Fits
## Instalocking Thrasher
This is the backbone of our gate camp fits. Locks very fast, is quite cheap (<4mill) and has some decent tank to survive gate guns for a bit. 
You should always align out to a ping before you shoot hostile ships on a gate. Warp off immediately if  you get shot by the gate guns. 
Thrashers should be within jump range of the gate at all times.
