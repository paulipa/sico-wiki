## Skill Plan
To import a skillplan, go to the pastebin links and copy all of its contents.  Then go in-game and into your character sheet where your skills are. 

To the left of the section where it says "Training Queue", there is an icon of 4 horizontal lines.  Click this, then click "Add skills listed in clipboard to end of queue".

You can only do this with 50 skills at a time, hence why the skillplans are split up in blocks of up to 50.
