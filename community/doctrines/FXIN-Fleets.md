# Fatalix Industries [FXIN] Doctrines
These fits are NOT official LinkNet fits, and are intended for fleets hosted by Fatalix Industries.

## Kikimoras
Kiki man is coming for you. Doctrine primarily spider tanks, so max Kikis desrired. T1 armor destroyers can be used as a low skill option. Assault Frigs or Interceptors can be used for additional tackle.
Destroyers can be fit however you want, as long as they have a 200mm plate and 5mn MWD. 
2 to 3 logi frigates can be used if fleet size is large enough.
