# The Emissary Program
The emissary program is designed to allow third party entities to raise fleets for LinkNet members without the need of a permanent [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements) with the community.

## Requirements
In order to qualify for the emissary program you will need to ensure us that you are qualified to raise fleets for the content type you are aiming at. This is to make sure that all of the fleets, classes and events that are advertised for our community members reach our quality standards.

There are multiple ways for you to reach these quality standards:
- Have someone we know vouch for you
- Have positive public reputation for running NPSI fleets
- Prove your qualification by representing facts of your previous actions such as AAR's, killboards or news blogs

## Benefits
The emissary program is the easiest way to start interacting with LinkNet without a [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements). With the emissary program you will be given the required roles in our systems to share the required information needed for players to find out about your fleets or content.
- No need for a partnership
- Instant setup
- Free platform to advertise your content
- An easy way to reach out for tons of players

## Applying
1. Register on our [AUTH](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/) as a guest state user with a public scope.
1. Apply for the emissary role on our AUTH [group](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/groups/) section. This role is only visible for users with the guest state.
1. Activate your account on our [discord](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/tools/communication/discord)
1. Contact **Ikarus Cesaille** on our discord and provide required information for us to check that you match the requirements for the program

# Emissary Program Tools
You have two important tools given for you when you are accepted for the emissary program. These tools are used to share information for our memberbase about your content.

## Operations Calendar
The [operations calendar](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/opcalendar/) inculdes all the needed information for players to know about events and fleets that are scheduled to happen.

To schedule fleets on the operation calendar please see the guide in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#scheduling-fleets).

## Discord fleet pings
Once your fleet is about to go live you should ping it on our discord. In order to send out pings you will need to use the [fleet ping tool](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/fleetpings/) located on our AUTH.

> Note that we have a strict ping policy rule that that prohibits global pings such as @here or @everyone to be sent unless the operation qualifies as STRATOP or CTA to prevent *ping exhaustion*. Use the special interest groups to ping at the targeted players related to type of your content.

The guide for creating pings on our discord is located in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#discord-fleet-pings).
