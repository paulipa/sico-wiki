# The Emissary Program
The emissary program is designed to allow third party entities to raise fleets for LinkNet members without the need of a permanent [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements) with the community.

## Requirements
In order to qualify for the emissary program you will need to ensure us that you are qualified to raise fleets for the content type you are aiming at. This is to make sure that all of the fleets, classes and events that are advertised for our community members reach our quality standards.

There are multiple ways for you to reach these quality standards:
- Have someone we know vouch for you
- Have positive public reputation for running NPSI fleets
- Prove your qualification by representing facts of your previous actions such as AAR's, killboards or news blogs

## Benefits
The emissary program is the easiest way to start interacting with LinkNet without a [partnership](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/rules-and-requirements#partner-requirements). With the emissary program you will be given the required roles in our systems to share the required information needed for players to find out about your fleets or content.
- No need for a partnership
- Instant setup
- Free platform to advertise your content
- An easy way to reach out for tons of players
