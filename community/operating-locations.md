Each of our [coalition corporations](/community/coalition-corporations) have their own operating locations and systems which are only revealed for their corporation members. This section covers the general operation locations which are open for all of our coalition members.

# The Bleak Lands
Our Headquarters is located in the Bleak Lands region. This region is known for its faction warfare activity in the low security systems but ther than that the whole Bleak Lands pocket is a fairly quiet and secure space.

We offer several customs offices for planetary interactions in the Bleak Lands region. Each of the POCOS have a low 3% tax on them. In addition as with all high sec POCOs there is an NPC tax, which you can decrease with skills. Our POCOs are located in the following systems https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Bleak_Lands/ronne/hatori/hakodan/jarkkolen/junsen/malpara#sec

## Ronne
Our HQ is located in Ronne. From this location you will be able to find structures with a variety of services. Majrity of our fleet operations also depart from this location. It hosts an NPC station which is mainly not used for coalition purposes.

Ronne is close to low sec faction warfare space and providence null sec space. This makes it easy to find PvP content without the need of traveling far.

All core services are online in this operation location.
- Coalition HQ
- Market, manufacturing and research
- Fleet formup system

## Jarkkolen
Our high sec mining system. This system has the most asteroid belts in all of high sec space. With 50 asteroid belts in the system there is always something to be mined. This system is located 1 jump out from our HQ.

There are no NPC stations in this system. The coalition offers a public freeport station for miners to sell their ores via the [buyback program](/tools/buyback)

We host our [mining fleets](/services/ingame-services/mining-fleets) in this locaion almost 24/7. While in a mining fleet you will receive boosts, that will furthermore increase your mining efficiency.

This system is the closest triglavian invasion system to our HQ. In order to operate in this system you will need to have the proper standings.
