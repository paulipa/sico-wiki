# Shit Needs to be Done
**Description**
We mine the ore to refine for minerals
We use the minerals to build the ships
The ships we build to sell to you,
The ships we build to shoot you with,
The ships we use to pod you.

While we prioritize the Industrial side of EVE. We believe that in order to have something of value, force must be ready and swift to protect it. We require all members to be willing to learn how to do small gang warfare as well as large fleet battles. We ask, but do not require at least two fleets a month. In return we will work on providing you the opportunities to join said fleets. Everything from filament roams to large fights leaving the rest of the time for you to do with as you wish. We also ask that when called to defend our space and that of our allies we will step up to keep our doctrine as simple as possible. 

## **Requirements**
( For your main character only. Alts are a different matter.)
**Skill Points:** minimum 5 million points

Minimum of being able to fly tech one cruisers with meta weapons for both minimatar and caldari. 
Minimum of Basic shield skills, preference to close to perfect as possible.
A desire to live in nullsec and participate in itâ€™s events and reap the success and failures from them. 

## **Validus Directives ( Bushido )**

**Justice:** Justice is a core value of the Samurai. Incorporating the Bushido principle of justice into your life requires reflecting on what is fair and upholding the value of upstanding moral character. 

**Courage:** Courage, like justice, entails deciphering what is right and wrong. Courage requires the strength not only to perceive but also to act.  

**Compassion:** Compassion is the ability to manifest love and sympathy through patience. It also requires attempting to see the world from the perspective of another. This is an especially important trait for those in a leadership role.

**Respect:** Respect means that you acknowledge your regard for the experiences and feelings of others. In order to collaborate with another person, politeness must be employed.  

**Integrity:** In order to practice many of the other principles listed, one has to maintain integrity. This means living honestly and sincerely.   

**Honor:** Samurai were warriors who upheld a sense of self worth and lived by the highest code of conduct. In order to abide by the principle of honor, you must acknowledge your moral responsibilities.

**Loyalty:** First, stay true to yourself. When fealty is given to another, this must not be abandoned even under difficult circumstances.

**Self-control:** Self-control in the Bushido code means adhering to this code under all circumstances, when with others and when alone.

In short, don't be a dick
Treat others fairly, in a manner you wish to be treated.
If you screw up, own it and you will be treated as fair as possible.
Know when you need to walk away from a fight as well as when to jump in.
Hold the god damned pod and wait for everyone to get on that kill mail.
