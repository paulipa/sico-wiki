Silent Industry is the High Security Industry Wing for the Silent Coalition

Just like a NPC corporation with benefits! Why stick in a NPC corporation with random players when you can be in a player corporation with friends?

How you want to benefit from us is completely up to you, just like in NPC corporations. The great difference with us and NPC corporations is that we have a lot more to offer with the same level of risks that they offer!

As a member of SiCO you will be enjoying the full range of our services, including our corporation management framework! This alliance is not war eligible and youâ€™ll be in an industry focused corporation helping support the other wings of SICO.

Silent Industry is for people who are particularly interested in Industry and Mining operations. We still benefit from all of the Coalition infrastructure, with the aim of providing industry support and building ships for alliance PVP and PVE operations.

Recruitment status: Open

Point of contacts:
Cismet
Ikarus Cesaille
