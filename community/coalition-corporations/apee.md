People of the Saiya’s origin is from the show called Dragonball Z.  I, Jared Sogness, am a weeb through and through. I am a huge fan of Anime and wanted to make a Anime type themed corporation.  I began to look through the type of Symbols there are on the creating-a-corp page.  I noticed, hey that symbol looks alot like Super Saiyan hairstyle. At that moment, I had decided it was going to be somthing to do with the Saiyan race.  I tried to find alternate ways to say Saiyans and then I came across an article calling Saiyans, “The People of the Saiya.” Thus the origin of the name of our Corporation.

I made this corporation for those individuals who hate the fact that anywhere in this game you go, you have to pay taxes or are forced into a Corporation where you must pay taxes.  “Hey, I’m going to cater to those new players that hate the fact that, while they are learning the game they are losing a portion of there income right away.”

Every week we have a thousand or so people who download and try this game. a Very small portion of those people who actually get inside the game and log in, stick around.  Somwhere in the ballpark of 5% (before we started SiCo) was reported.  Retention is a massive part of this game and is strongly needed to be changed. I made this corp also because I have a goal or mission in mind to help those new players who join soley have a community of new players with 0% taxes, tons of resources for them to learn all aspects of the game, and then send them off to a more advanced Corporation so they can continue to learn and advance in this game.  In our Coalition, we have all kinds of Corporations; Nullsec, Wormhole, PVP Small Roam, PVP Nullsec, Industry, Hauling, etc.  We have somthing aimed towards everyone and we encourage people to try all aspects of the game if they dont particularly like a certain type.  I encourage everyone to learn and get better.

I look forward to seeing you all ingame, reach out if you ever have any questions at all.
