# About Us
Fatalix Industries is a wormhole corporation and long time member of LinkNet.

Originally founded in 2006, Fatalix has an extensive history of activity throughout New Eden. While our identity has changed over the years, we've always remained a group who focused on making sure the game was fun, and maintaining a positive atmosphere. We take the game seriously while not letting it get in the way of real life.

While Fatalix isn't a "newbro" corp, we've always put great effort into helping players explore new parts of the game. If you've been playing Eve for a while, but have never experienced wormhole life, come check us out!
