# Who are we, you ask?

Game of Drones is a Nullsec Mining, Industrial and Planetary Interaction specialized Corporation within the Silent Coalition and Null Sec. With many of us enjoying the carebear lifestyle but with the options to delve into bigger things, such as PVP.

We aim to create a great place for like-minded players that also wish to experience all that eve has to offer. And give our members an opportunity to make large amounts of ISK.

## Where are we located?

Currently, we are living in Nullsec space under Fraternity control. The region is also shared with members of Winter Coalition.

## What do we offer?

Game of Drones boasts a massive collection of over 1000 Blueprint Originals that members have access to use and make their own copies. We also have a player curated general store that is available for all corp members to use. There are two market hubs only a few jumps out of our staging system, that are stocked with hundreds of items, making for a great place to trade.

Our members enjoy taking on big projects such as Capital, Sub-Capital production, and operating as a frontline wartime supplier. Plus smaller projects such as; stocking markets with needed items and building fuel for allied starbases so there will always be something for you to do. Within our area of space, there are many choices open to you beyond just mining and industry. Thanks to our alliance and association to WinterCo. we have access to bigger fleets aimed at PVP and PvE such as roaming, WH day trips and more. We also have some active and helpful intel channels, these are here to help keep you safe from threats such as roaming groups and gankers while you are playing in Null Sec space.

## What we require of you.

In order to become a part of Game of Drones, you will need to fulfill some basic requirements. Though we are an entry-level corp, null-sec is a harsh and unforgiving place. These requirements are here for you to be able to make the most of your time in Null Sec

- A) Have been within any of Silent Coalition’s corporations for at least 30 days, or Previously have lived in Null Sec for more than 60 days.
- B) You will need to have at least 3.5 million skill points and be able to at least fly a fit procurer or an entry level ratting ship. This will also mean that you will need to be Omega. Though it is not required, some basic skills into PVP ships and accompanying fittings will be a big plus.
- C) Be willing to work as a team, while we generally let people pursue the activities that interest them the most, please be willing to work towards a common goal within the corporation. Such as; Mining ores if we need more minerals or Setting up Planetary if a big job requires it.
- D) In order to keep both the corp and our alliance safe, we review incoming members. This does not mean that if you have previously been part of another big null bloc that we will refuse you. We just want to know any pertinent information so that we are aware of the situation as it stands so that we may keep our corp a fun place for all.
- E) You Will be required to auth with WinterCo. No Exceptions.

While many of the corporations within the Silent Coalition have Doctrines that are to be used within PVP fleets, Game of Drones does not require them. Instead, for Mining fleets, we provide you with an optional setup to help you get started building your mining ship. Through our alliance, we do have some PVP/Defense doctrines that are highly suggested that you be able to fly if you wish to help defend our home or participate in ongoing wars abroad. We also expect you to actively take part in relaying intel to help keep our fellow players safe while operating within Null Sec.

# The Rules within the corporation are very simple:
1. Don’t be a dick. Seriously, no one likes an asshole and it ruins the fun.
1. Help your fellow members and corp as a whole.
1. Be smart, keep your eyes open and always report intel to the correct channels.
1. ????
1. $ Profit $

There is always something for everyone to enjoy. So let’s go forth and dominate New Eden for fun and profit!
