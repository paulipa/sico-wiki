The Ringing Vale is continuing its search for pilots that want to work hand-in-hand with their corporation towards a shared goal. Our current members range in experience from recent Academy graduates, to veterans of the various pathways in space, and somewhere in-between.

We're active in most timezones, run regular social fleet events, have a community, fun and IRL first focus and indulge in a little lore-play when appropriate.

What activities do we offer?

- Mining: hi-sec/lo-sec mining, moon mining, gas huffing and ice mining fleets
- PvE: Abyssal, hi-sec/lo-sec missions, EVE events and combat anomaly/escalations fleets.
- PvP: Small/medium gang roams, Alliance exclusive Faction Warfare alt corp, Fleet v Fleet actions w/friendlies, all-sec defence contracts and losec Gate camps.
- Exploration: WH PvE/PvP/hacking lockdown, scout & intel, hacking and anomaly scanning fleets.

We have FC's to facilitate activities in each area of gameplay, and/or provide guidance and information.

The Ringing Vale has business minded goals in new Eden and as such offers services and Corp funded work via our "departments" system. This allows our members to enjoy the opportunity to maximize their learning potential towards their chosen EVE career and contribute to the goals and successes of the corporation at large. Your success is our success.
