METROPOLIS - ALPHA & RETURNING VET FIRENDLY - IRL FIRST - US/EU/AU

The Ringing Vale is a Metropolis based Mining and Industrial corporation with interests in regular PvP and PvE activities that operates within hi-sec & lo-sec. 
with it's own developing lore, players active in all timezones and regular fleet activities for everyone in every style of gameplay, The Ringing Vale offers a rich and dynamic play style to suit everyone.

Our goal is to build up a successful industry hub and market in our region, have the ability to supply it with raw materials & industry products from all areas of space and defend it at a moments notice. To achieve this we have a department based system run by dedicated EVE Online veterens who also take the time to train new pilots in their chosen fields of gameplay and introduce them to new activities (so long as they meet our skill requirements). 

We're close to null and low-sec space which provides us plenty of opportunities for activities and have an IRL and fun first focus. 

**AIP**

We provide services such as Refining, buyback, SRP for events, contract exchange, Faction warfare alt corp, special events, specially catered industrial stations, competitions, low risk war content opportunities and access to friendly lo-sec systems & industrial structures. All deisgned to give players from every walk of space life the edge they need to succeed in their prospective careers and become further "ISK Positive".
