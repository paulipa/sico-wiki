  <h1> Simple Businessmen </h1>
  

<p>We are a corp that is interested in everything Eve has to offer. We do not like the idea of sticking with one “area” of gameplay. Here at S1MP., we embrace all the various styles of gameplay people enjoy, whether that be PvP, Industry, Mining, Exploration, or Ratting.</p>
  <p>What makes us different? What makes us different from every other null sec corp is our combined focus on the corp and working to ensure that our members have all the tools needed to succeed. We put a huge emphasis on attempting to generate as much isk as possible through various different sources of revenue. With this collective mindset we are able to achieve things many people simply will not be able to otherwise achieve. If the corp does well, the members will do well. Our Goal? To be the optimal revenue-generating galactic body.</p>
  <p>What do you have to offer compared to other corps? One of the biggest selling points for our corp is that we also have a massive BPO library containing everything from t1 ships to capital components and hulls, which can be used by anyone who is a member of our corp. We also offer our members the ability to play Eve around their schedule. We will never dictate when you need to log in! We want people to hang out and enjoy playing video games with us, but real life is always the number 1 priority.</p>
  <p>When can I apply? You can apply at any time! Though we do have recruiting standards. Those are:

- A minimum of 30 days in Linknet or any other “Entry” Corp/Alliance. OR 7.5 Mil Skill points.
- Must be an Active OMEGA status account. 
- We do not allow you to have mains or alts in any other major corp or Alliance (SEADC/SLTRN alts excluded).</p>

If you have any questions about anything in this document or questions regarding applying for the corp please feel free to contact a member of our leadership team in game or on discord
