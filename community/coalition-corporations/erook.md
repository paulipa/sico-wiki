Welcome to EVE Rookies!

EVE Rookies [EROOK] is a public group dedicated to running fleets aimed at rookie players, but all experience levels are welcome! While we started by focusing on incursions in 2021, by the end of that year we added FOBs (forward bases) to our fleet offerings. 2022 saw our fleets rapidly expand by adding mission fleets, mining fleets and in 2023 we've started wormhole ratting fleets and will be adding abyssal fleets as well!

- SOE mission fleet: pve mission fleet that takes place in high sec specifically with Sisters of Eve mission givers
- PVP newbro roam: generally done in cooperation with NPSI group FUN Inc, roam is GRIP level and suitable for a rookie. Ship handouts and SRP is available.
