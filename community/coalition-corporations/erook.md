Welcome to EVE Rookies!

EVE Rookies [EROOK] is a public group dedicated to running fleets aimed at rookie players, but all experience levels are welcome! We are primarily focused on lowering the bar of incursions (high end PVE content) so that lower skilled players and alpha's can participate in a chill environment.

As part of our incursion project, we not only provide a skill plan for the Praxis but we also have handouts! All you need is to bring 250m isk in exchange for a ship! Hand our ship back and fly away with your 250m + 70-100m per hour the fleet runs! There's no better way to see if this particular PVE content is for you!

In addition to VG incursions, there are weekly FOB (forward base) fleets, bi-weekly lvl 4 mission fleets and newbro pvp roam fleets, and newly added is a deep space mining fleet!

All of our sanctioned activities are open to Link Net members as well as the general public!
