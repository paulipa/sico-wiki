Welcome to EVE Rookies!

EVE Rookies [EROOK] is a corporation dedicated to running public events for rookie players (and vets too!). We are primarily focused on lowering the bar of incursions (high end PVE content) so that lower skilled players and alpha's can participate in a chill environment.

As part of our incursion project, we not only provide a skill plan for the Praxis but we also have handouts! All you need is to bring 250m isk in exchange for a ship! Hand our ship back and fly away with your 250m + 70-100m per hour the fleet runs! There's no better way to see if this particular PVE content is for you!

Additionally, Eve Rookies often holds pveVP events in low and null. These fleets generally are combat anomolies in low/null, event sites in low, ratting in wormholes or gate ratting in null. The primary focus is on the PVE part, but we're always ready for some PVP to happen!

All of our sanctioned activities are open to Link Net members as well as the general public!
