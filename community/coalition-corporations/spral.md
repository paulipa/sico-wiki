Are you travelling New Eden by yourself or looking for somewhere new?  Are you looking for guidance on how to play the game?  Spectral Incorporated are taking new and old players into our folds to help you in every way we can.

What is SPRAL?  Spectral Incorporated (SPRAL) is an EU, new-player friendly community centred around providing players with a setting where they can get to know the people they fly with as they integrate within our smaller, tight-knit community which you wouldnâ€™t see in some of the massive corporations with thousands of players.

To us - you aren't a number, you are a like-minded gamer and a member of our prosperous community.  We have a dedicated helper team of six who can answer any of your questions within our questions-and-answers channel, as well as hand you out free corp ships straight from HQ.

If you are a brand new player, you might not yet know much about corporations at the moment.  I can safely say however that joining a player corporation is the single best decision you can ever make in this game.  Joining SPRAL specifically enables you to take advantage of a huge array of services, activities and learning.

What does Spectral Incorporated have to offer?

- PvP Fleets you can join everyday if you wish.
- 24/7 mining fleet with free orca boosts - earn way more isk with your mining!
- Industrial structures with bonuses to reprocessing ore and constructing blueprints.
- Free fully-fitted pvp, pve and mining ships straight out of HQ, No strings attached.
- Questions and Answers channel on our discord where our dedicated helper team can answer your questions
- Groups on almost every aspect of Eve Online

---
What do we require from our members?

- Able to be on the game at EU time (Roughly between 17:00 and 21:00 evetime).  Evetime is UTC +00:00 and is found at the bottom left of your screen.
- Have the discord application installed and willing to join our discord (No need to talk or even connect to a voice chat, simply to join and read our text channels)
- Willing to move towards or near our HQ at Ronne - SiCO Trade Center, we can offer you advice on how to safely and quickly do this,
- Willing to log on once per month (If you need to take a holiday, or just in general want a break from the game, simply mention it and you will be exempted from this)
