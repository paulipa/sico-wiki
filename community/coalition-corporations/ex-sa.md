We're a small, EU based, alpha friendly, hi-sec corp that operates mostly between Gallente & Caldari space but our pilots are free to roam around New Eden at their own pace and leasure.

Our main focus is getting people into Abyssal sites and running as many PVP roaming fleets as we can - be it with our coalition or the rest of our NPSI friends!

## Corporation requirements

Apart from a soft-requirement of **5mil skillpoints**, we don't require any info from you except the info you are willing to share with the rest of the corporation members yourself. We don't require you to undergo pointless background checks, no ESI key requirements, no doctrines... We firmly believe that everyone should play EVE as they want, when they want and how they want.

We won't force you into spending money on ships you can't fly efficiently nor ping you with countless fleet-ups in the middle of the work day and then nag about you having low PAPs at the end of the month.

That said - we won't tolerate assholes, negativity, drama, scamming or shooting own corp members. EVE is a beautiful game that we all log into to have fun and not get irritated more after a hard day of work.
