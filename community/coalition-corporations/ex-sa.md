We are a small, EU based, newbro friendly, hi-sec corp that operates mostly in Gallente space (with offices in Caldari, Minmatar and low-sec Amarr space) but our pilots are free to roam around New Eden at their own pace and leasure.

If you're interested in finding more about us, please come and take a look at our [website](https://ex-sa.surge.sh).
