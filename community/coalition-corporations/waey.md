# Wormhole Academy for Exploration and Yeet
This is the WAEY.

Now you're probably wondering about the WAEY to where.

WAEY is an entry level Wormhole corp for those that wish to try out life in a low-class J-space location. First off, low class does not mean we're trashy.  Wormhole class refers to the relative difficulty of the environment in the system with lower classes being easier than, you guessed it, higher classes. The WAEY home location has rats that won't kill you instantly and is permanently connected to High Security space so it's easy to get into and out of. We're also connected to a mid-class wormhole that we use to make isk in. DISCLAIMER: Actual location of connections changes every day.

There are two goals for WAEY. First and foremost is for you to have fun in the game. Second goal is to learn about the joys and rewards that come with J-space life. We are partnered with the more advanced Wormhole Corp (Nevermore) who can offer assistance to new players, so you're not left to figure everything out on your own.

Reasons why you should come check us out:

1. Living in J-space is fun.
2. There are great opportunities for solo and group isk making. These include ratting, exploration, planetary interaction, industry, gas huffing and even mining!
3. Active discord (might not be a plus if you don't like to talk to people, but we're a pretty fun bunch).
4. Thrill of seeing a different part of New Eden every day.

Questions? Ask in our recruitment channel on LN discord, the wormhole special interest group or just ping Martin Dagoalie in one of the channels.
