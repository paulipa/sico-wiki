# Description of Corporation 
Welcome to the Suddenly Spaceless Wikipedia Article

We are a small casual Corporation in Eve Online.  We are the founding member of Literally Triggered Alliance.  Proud members of Winter Coalition up in the North.  

We are well established and have been around for many years now.

We are a PVP focused Corporation however we have lots of people who also do industry and different types of krabbing. (Making Money in Null).

Primary Time zone is EU. 

## Where are we located?
We are between Vale and Tribute. Overall Super close to Jita, 1 JumpBrdge and a few gates to home.  (Our Alliance Staging is in Tribute)

(Not Counting the Coalition's Assets)
The Alliance itself now has its very own 2 Keepstars!
as well as Sotiyos and Tataras!
Even some fancy Faction Fortizars!
