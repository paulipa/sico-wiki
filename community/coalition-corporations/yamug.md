AU/NZ NEWBRO HS CORPORATION

A High Sec corporation for all EvE new comers to join and learn the skills of EvE with complete safety from being scammed or fed lies for someone elses gain and wallet.

We are currently AU/NZ Timezone, however we would also like to welcome any US or EU Timezone players as well.

Consortium is located in Hageken in Lonetrek, we have chosen this system and region as it see's us nice and close to the Jita Market Hub and also to our parent null sec corporation, which allows us to meet up and roam in some pretty fun space.


What is on offer:

♠ Free hand out ships to learn PvP, Mining, Mission Running, Scanning etc
♠ Lessons, tutorials and advice from experienced vets of EvE.
♠ Access to Null Sec Corp once you graduate and feel comfortable to dive in to null sec (no obligation however).
♠ Skill Plans & Books
♠ SRP
♠ Corp Wiki
♠ Access to an ingame group chat that contains players to answer your questions.
♠ Access to a joint discord that contains our own area plus a help channel that is seen by experienced players that can offer game advice.

Serentiy Consortium currently has 6 Mentors in corp, all with various backgrounds of knowledge and all are members of our parent Null Sec corp. We do however mainly focus on PVP, but with elements of PVE to aid in funding your PVP. There is pretty much no question that one of the 6 mewntors can't answer for you. 

Serenity Consortium is purely run from volunteers from our Null Sec parent Corp, who want to see EvE continue to evolve, as we all believe that by helping new guys and girls is the best way to see EvE continue to flourish.

We are strictly non-profit, we aren't here to make a quick get rich scheme from new players, this is NO BULLSHIT, NO CATCHES set up.

Our ultimate goal is to see our Consortium members progress to our Null Sec Corp, however it is not mandatory to do so, you may choose to remain and play in HS with us or move on to other adventures in eve, there is no obligations, it is your sub, your time, you play and go where you choose.

CORP MOTTO - There is no such thing as a stupid question, only a stupid answer.

If you are keen to get amongst it with us then please reach out to us in Discord.
