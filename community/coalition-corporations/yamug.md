Serenity Consortium currently has 6 volunteer Mentors, all with various backgrounds of knowledge and all are members of our partner Null Sec corp. We do however mainly focus on PVP, but with elements of PVE to aid in funding your PVP. There is pretty much no question that one of the 6 mentors can't answer for you. 

Serenity Consortium is purely run from those who want to see EvE continue to evolve, as we all believe that by helping new guys and girls is the best way to see EvE continue to flourish.
