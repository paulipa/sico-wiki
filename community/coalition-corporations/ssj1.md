We are the premier Nullsec Corporation

We are descendents of People of the Saiya, a Linknet Corporation

We pride ourselves on allowing players to play how they want without forcing them to one direct style of gameplay. PVP, PVE, and Industry are all completely acceptable ways to play the game in our space.

We are a member of Winter Coalition, however, Our Alliance is our first and foremost priority.  We in Literally Triggered are a close Tight-knit Family environment.  Literally Triggered comes first before any coalition we may fall under.

We hold our own SOV in Dronelands.  We have our own Capital division and Super Capital Division. This combined with Winter Coalition Super-Capital Umbrella holds us as a force to be cautious of.  

We use a Green/Red Light system to authorize the use of Super Capitals and Rorquals for Krabbing. When the light system is green this means we have enough players online to keep you and your fancy toys safe from any possible pirates that may want to destroy your investments.  

This is a great step if you are a newer player that wishes to dip their toes into the Nullsec life and see what it is like. We are Newbro friendly and offer one of the most profitable and safest spaces in the game to operate in at the advanced level.

I am Anlions V/Anlions X, I am the CEO of both People of the Saiya, and Super Saiyan Invasion.  If you wish to join there are 2 requirements you must know;

1. you must sign up on SEAT to apply and we can go over your Character history and interview process upon contacting me.
Seat Link: https://seat.winterco.org/home

2. You must be willing to communicate with us while online using the Voice program called "Mumble."

IF this is all okay to you feel free to send me an email or poke me on Discord for an interview today!
