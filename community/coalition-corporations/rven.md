So you want to be a wormholer, eh?

Go to J-space they said. Make loads of ISK they said. Life is quiet in a wormhole. Right? Right?! Well, sort of. 

It’s true there’s lots of opportunities in wormholes, and life here is quiet… a little too quiet maybe… and then 10x T3 cruisers just decloaked on top of you, and now you’re in your pod, thinking back on your adolescent years and wondering where you went wrong.
Yup, living in a wormhole can be thrilling – danger lurks around every corner and if you’re not the hunter you’re the prey. Heck, sometimes you’re both. Oh, and there’s always a bigger fish.
In fact, wormholes are probably the harshest and most challenging environment in all of New Eden (except maybe High Security space, right? Dude, that place is scary :D). Living in a wormhole takes hard work, dedication and in most cases – a strong, tight-knit community.
So yeah, it can be exciting, it can be lucrative, it can be dangerous… but it’s fun and it’s never boring.

## About us
Nevermore. (with a dot) is an English-speaking wormhole corporation operating in **EU/US timezone**. 
Our primary focus is living inside a wormhole system and building a community that enjoys everything that comes with it. 
But this wouldn't be possible without a lot of team-work in mapping our surroundings and in coming together for any industrial/hauling job, PVE activity or PVP encounter.


### Short history
Our corporation is the result of a merger between the active playerbases of two well known corporations that have been part of the coalition’s community partners since its early days – RASAX and Heaven’s Angels [HVEN] – hence our ticker: [.RVEN].

While our name and brand are relatively new to the coalition landscape and especially to the EVE wormhole community, we haven't forgotten our core values: **playing with friends and teaching people how to play, so we have more friends to play with**.

With a new leadership and a refreshed playerbase, we strive to make a name for ourselves and to constantly improve as a wormhole group. Our current community is as diverse as the coalition, and so is our experience. Our RASAX branch boasts a yeet-first mentality and jack-of-all-trades background that includes living in Null Sec, Low Sec, J-space and even Trig-space. Conversely, our former-HVEN wormholers bring us the knowledge, skill and experience that come from years of living in J-space .


## What we can offer:
- An easygoing, relaxed community, focused on having fun playing together.
- Organized PvP and PvE activities.
- Discord server, Auth services and website guides.
- Infrastructure for PI, industry and refining needs.
- Experienced players willing to teach you about J-space and who will have your back in a scrape.
- A place to dock your ship and hang your hat – a home among the wormhole stars.

# Joining requirements
## From your character:
>  Minimum of 10 million Skill Points
{.is-info}

> Omega account strongly preferred 
{.is-info}

> 30 days minimum in one of the coalition’s other corporations
{.is-info}

> Completed MQP and participated in a total of at least 10 PvP coalition fleets 
{.is-warning}

> Ability (and willingness) to train into corp doctrines (specific ships and fittings).
{.is-warning}

Living in J-space means having to do PvP (whether you like it or not). We want to know that you can handle yourself and that you are familiar with the basic principles of PvP and fleet mechanics/discipline. That also includes accepting that your ship is meant to blow up and not ragequitting over ship losses.
Unfortunately, not being able to fly certain ships and use certain modules can preclude you from participating in fleet activities. And there’s not much point in being in a corporation if you can’t take part in any of its activities, right?

While it is possible to survive as an Alpha for a limited time as you work your way back to Omega, in the long run, it’s hard to be a fully integrated member in our wormhole environment without access to the **Omega-exclusive skills**.

Thirty days is the minimum requirement; we may require longer. Exceptions can be made in special cases, but in general, before you join our core group, we want a chance for you to get to know the coalition and for the coalition to get to know you.

## From you:
> - Follow and obey the corporation and coalition rules.
> - Willingness to learn our mapping/bookmarking rules and tools.
> - Be respectful, be friendly.
> - Team-player mentality. Support your fellow members and your corporation as a whole.
> - Say hello once in a while.

Other that this, nothing is mandatory. Play as much as you want – when you want. Obviously, there are times where having as many people as possible would be especially appreciated. However, this is a game and real life comes first – for all of us.

# How to apply
If you fulfill the above requirements and you are interested in joining please contact **Cephast** on Discord: `Cephas28#6481`
