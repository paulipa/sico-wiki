R.S.M is a 12 year old corporation that has been in High, Null and Low Sec and is currently enrolled in Amarr Faction warfare.

As one of the largest and most active corps in FW, we are regularly the backbone of Militia fleets and have been instrumental with taking control of the warzone since rejoining in December 2019.

We are PVP focused but do not mind people losing ships whilst learning how to fight, we can offer advice and some free t1 frigates and destroyers for plexing work

To join, add yourself to the public channel : `Red Sky Morning Public` and talk to our recruiters, Chib, IVAN KILLYA or CDLoon
