SEADC is the entry corporation and active High Sec routing department of LinkNet community for players who seek to actively interact with the rest of our community!

While the entry corporation has no requirements and you can keep on playing the game as you feel like to, we highly recommend that you interact with other community members and take part in our activities. There are tons of different types of activities and fleets for you to join for and the best way to learn about the different career options in EVE is to try them out!

One of the hardest thing in EVE is to learn to understand to universe around you. EVE is an complex game and it is almost impossible to learn to master the different aspects of the game by relying on the information provided for you only by the game client.

For this reason playing EVE heavily relies on third party tools and sites that will help you connect with older players, gain information about the events happening around you and learn the basics of different mechanisms.

The goal of this corporation is to allow you to get to know different types of gameplay options so that you can then pick a corporation later on that might have more requirements from you but also offer more focused content within your interest areas.

> In other words our goal is not to keep you in SEADC but push you out into a corporation that is specializing in the same things you want to focus on.

## Joining requirements
We are the new way of starting out your EVE career. We open our doors for all age and type of pilots as long as you have a friendly and mature attitude and are able to communicate in English!

We accept both players within the coalition and outside of the coalition with the following requirements:

- You must have a friendly and mature attitude
- You must be able to communicate in English
- You must register on AUTH and our discord

## Life in SEADC
How you want to live your life while in SEADC is completely up to you. You may join our joint operations held by other coalition corporations and participate in activities such as wormhole diving, low and null sec roaming and mining. Each of the coalition corporations is trying to provide you a sneak peak of their own way of life by offering you these operations.

As you grow older and have had the chance to experience different types of gameplay you most likely will figure out the things you want to focus on in EVE. This is when SiCO and SEADC will try to find you the perfect corporation to move into. If this corporation can be found inside the coalition then that’s great! In this situation you can still interact with the friends you have made in the coalition in the past by joining the joint operations and chatting with them on our channels. If the corporation can’t be found inside the coalition the new we will try to guide you towards corporations outside of our coalitions.

In other words if you wish to focus on something more advanced SEADC is most likely not your final destination!

However if you only want to chill and be a laid back player you are always free to remain in SEADC as long as you want. If you think that this is exactly how you want to play the game then we have already found you your perfect corporation!

As we in SiCO do not have any mandatory operations is it also up to you to decide how much you want to interact with us. If you choose so, you can simply use us for chatting purposes only and keep on with your solo activities.

All the services we offer for our members are at your disposal regardless of what your endgame goals are and how much you interact with the rest of the coalition.
