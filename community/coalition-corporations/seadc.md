Welcome to SEADC, formally known as Strategic Exploration and Development Corp. SEADC is the oldest corporation in SiCO as well as the founder corporation for the coalition.

We are just like a NPC corporation, but with benefits! Why stick in a NPC corporation with random players when you can be in a player corporation with friends and enjoy the benefits from the coalition?

This corporation serves as the entry level corporation for the coalition and as the feeder corporation for other corporations both inside and outside of the coalition. While in SEADC you have no mandatory operations or required play hours, you can simply play the game as you wish to play it. If you want you can participate in cross corporation operations in different areas of space taking part in PVE, PVP, mining and industry in all security areas. This way you are able to get a sneak peak of what different activities looks like without the need of dedicating yourself right away by joining a new corporation. If you wish not to take part in any fleet or group activities then that is your right as well. If you choose so you can simply use SEADC and SiCO as a social corporation and keep on with your solo activities.

Our ultimate goal in SEADC is to find you a corporation that matches your personal goals and gameplay needs in EVE. While we do have several corporations within the coalition doing different things there might be situations when we simply can’t provide the perfect corporation for your personal needs within the coalition. In situations like this we try to guide you towards corporations and entities that are not part of the coalition that we think would work out for you. We hold no political stances against any entities so we are completely neutral in our guidance.

> In other words our goal is not to keep you in SEADC but push you out into a corporation that is specializing in the same things you want to focus on.

## Joining requirements
We are the new way of starting out your EVE career. We open our doors for all age and type of pilots as long as you have a friendly and mature attitude and are able to communicate in English!

We accept both players within the coalition and outside of the coalition with only two requirements:

- You must have a friendly and mature attitude
- You must be able to communicate in English

## Life in SEADC
How you want to live your life while in SEADC is completely up to you. You may join our joint operations held by other coalition corporations and participate in activities such as wormhole diving, low and null sec roaming and mining. Each of the coalition corporations is trying to provide you a sneak peak of their own way of life by offering you these operations.

As you grow older and have had the chance to experience different types of gameplay you most likely will figure out the things you want to focus on in EVE. This is when SiCO and SEADC will try to find you the perfect corporation to move into. If this corporation can be found inside the coalition then that’s great! In this situation you can still interact with the friends you have made in the coalition in the past by joining the joint operations and chatting with them on our channels. If the corporation can’t be found inside the coalition the new we will try to guide you towards corporations outside of our coalitions.

In other words if you wish to focus on something more advanced SEADC is most likely not your final destination!

However if you only want to chill and be a laid back player you are always free to remain in SEADC as long as you want. If you think that this is exactly how you want to play the game then we have already found you your perfect corporation!

As we in SiCO do not have any mandatory operations is it also up to you to decide how much you want to interact with us. If you choose so, you can simply use us for chatting purposes only and keep on with your solo activities.

All the services we offer for our members are at your disposal regardless of what your endgame goals are and how much you interact with the rest of the coalition.
