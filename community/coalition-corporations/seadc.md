Welcome to SEADC, formally known as Strategic Exploration and Development Corp. SEADC is the oldest corporation in SiCO as well as the founder corporation for the coalition.

We are just like a NPC corporation, but with benefits! Why stick in a NPC corporation with random players when you can be in a player corporation with friends and enjoy the benefits from the coalition?

Our ultimate goal in SEADC is to find you a corporation that matches your personal goals and gameplay needs in EVE. While we do have several corporations within the coalition doing different things there might be situations when we simply can’t provide the perfect corporation for your personal needs within the coalition. In situations like this we try to guide you towards corporations and entities that are not part of the coalition that we think would work out for you. We hold no political stances against any entities so we are completely neutral in our guidance.

> In other words our goal is not to keep you in SEADC but push you out into a corporation that is specializing in the same things you want to focus on.

## Joining requirements
We are the new way of starting out your EVE career. We open our doors for all age and type of pilots as long as you have a friendly and mature attitude and are able to communicate in English!

We accept both players within the coalition and outside of the coalition with the following requirements:

- You must have a friendly and mature attitude
- You must be able to communicate in English
- You must register on AUTH and our discord

> Failure to register on AUTH and Discord will result for your removal from the corporation. If you seek not to register on these services, please join the entry level corporations instead.

## Life in SEADC
How you want to live your life while in SEADC is completely up to you. You may join our joint operations held by other coalition corporations and participate in activities such as wormhole diving, low and null sec roaming and mining. Each of the coalition corporations is trying to provide you a sneak peak of their own way of life by offering you these operations.

As you grow older and have had the chance to experience different types of gameplay you most likely will figure out the things you want to focus on in EVE. This is when SiCO and SEADC will try to find you the perfect corporation to move into. If this corporation can be found inside the coalition then that’s great! In this situation you can still interact with the friends you have made in the coalition in the past by joining the joint operations and chatting with them on our channels. If the corporation can’t be found inside the coalition the new we will try to guide you towards corporations outside of our coalitions.

In other words if you wish to focus on something more advanced SEADC is most likely not your final destination!

However if you only want to chill and be a laid back player you are always free to remain in SEADC as long as you want. If you think that this is exactly how you want to play the game then we have already found you your perfect corporation!

As we in SiCO do not have any mandatory operations is it also up to you to decide how much you want to interact with us. If you choose so, you can simply use us for chatting purposes only and keep on with your solo activities.

All the services we offer for our members are at your disposal regardless of what your endgame goals are and how much you interact with the rest of the coalition.
