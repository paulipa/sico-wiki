# Greetings and Salutations!

This is your friendly neighborhood Don Purple to inform you about all the wonderful fantastical things about our friendly little Snuggle Society.

This corporation is dedicated to full on shenanigans wherever we seem to be, we are currently out in NPC Null wanting to get some nice drops going.

We focus in the fantastic arts of Ganking, Stealing, Scamming, War, Baiting, Blopsing, and last but not least delivering the highest quality snuggles any can find on the market.

If you are interested in ANY of these activities please feel free to contact a member of our diplomatic or contractual relations. We take new players and enjoy teaching them the ropes and getting them into the darker side of the game.

You can also contact Snuggle Society for contractual jobs like Awoxing, Ganking, and Spying if you ever need some of that in your life. We as a group have been in the business of such things for years now. Please reference https://eve-search.com/thread/346867-1 if you would like to see some of our past clients and references. Hopefully it will make you interested in our play sytle if anything.

This is a beta rough draft of this section for now and updates will be made soon. ( I'm bad at updates )

Take care!
Don
