# **AEGIS REFORGED**



**We’re a new corporation** formed from a small core of veterans and fresh meat alike. The corp is a member of the Already Replaced [AARP.] alliance. Like us, they have a firm belief in real life (RL) taking precedence over pixel starships and together we mine, build and fight daily over the most contested space, and against some of the best pilots, in New Eden.

**So, what can we provide?** Honestly, as a corp, we’re still growing, so initially, we can provide you a group of folks you enjoy spending time in voice chat with, and blowing up internet spaceships with (whether it’s someone else’s or your own remains to be seen). Our primary focuses are PvP and PvE, and being a part of a sovereignty holding nullsec alliance grants us access to that content in spades. There are PvP fleets almost daily, often multiple per day. The space we control and support has combat site, mining and industry opportunity aplenty so there's no shortage of ISK to be made. 

**What do we expect from you?** We need you to be active; not necessarily every day, but we don’t want you to just be a name on our corporation roster. Your character must be able to fly combat ships to support our corp, our alliance, and our coalition allies. We have some very good space to live in, and that’s only because everyone contributes to its defense and support.

If you're interesting in trying out Nullsec and feel like you have what it takes to learn the ins and outs of SovNull or are simply interested in joining a reliable crew with plenty of content to provide then please feel free to drop *Cephelange du'Krevviq* an in game mail and we can arrange a time to talk.

6m SP requirement - Omega only - Intermediate and Veteren capsuleers alike welcome!
