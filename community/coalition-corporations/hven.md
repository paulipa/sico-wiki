# Heaven’s Angels – Wormhole Corporation

Wormhole Space in Eve is the harshest and most challenging environment in New Eden. Most pilots never get an opportunity to truly thrive and take advantage of such an awesome part of space.

Heaven’s Angels believes that when pilots get an opportunity to fly as a team and conquer the challenges in J-Space, they find a new found love of the game. The ISK and content found in wormhole space when shared with like-minded folks can help a person enjoy their gaming time even more.

We are a Wormhole Community that provides a home and sanctuary to good-hearted pilots because every Eve Player deserves the opportunity to thrive.

When people fly and achieve goals together, their spirits come alive.

# Mission Statement

# Things to do in Wormhole Space:
## Exploration
Some of the best exploration sites in the game are located in Class 1 – 3 Wormholes. With Direct access to these types of wormholes, explorers can find relic and data sites that will fill their cargo holds with riches and excitement.

## Gas Huffing
Gas cloud harvesting or, “Gas Huffing”, is one of the most lucrative ways to generate ISK in eve as both a new player and experienced resource harvester. Wormhole Space holds the mysteries of Gas Cloud sites that have the C-320 and C-540 Gas Clouds. This gas is used to manufacture T3 Cruisers and Destroyers. We work together and provide Porpoise boosts to harvest some of the highest valued resources in game.

## Ratting and PvE Fleets
Killing Sleepers in wormhole space is the equivalent of PvE in K-Space. Some of the most challenging PvE Rats are found in higher class J-Space and require a fleet to extract the riches from these alien creatures. If you enjoy Level 4/5 Missioning, this will take your skills to the next level. As Angels, we work together to generate an amazing amount of ISK. 

## Small Gang PvP
Wormhole Space is some of the most dynamic and fun areas of space in Eve. With random connections at any given moment, opportunities for content are abundant! Wormhole Bushido is customary to give good fights when they are presented to you. We play in Wormhole space to make a lot of ISK and allow us to blow a lot of ships up (including our own). We are constantly improving our PvP skills and expect all pilots to participate in PvP when content is presented to us.
