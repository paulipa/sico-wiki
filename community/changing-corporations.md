# Changing Corporations
If you are looking to find a new corporation within the coalition then this is the right place to get started. While we hope that we are able to offer content for all different types of players within our own coalition we do not punish you in any way if you decide to join a corporation that is not part of our coalition.

All we care about is that you find a place that fits your personal playstyle.

## What corporations can i join
Official SICO corporations are located in here [coalition-corporations](/community/coalition-corporations)

In order to access the page you will need to log in with EVE SSO.

Click on the corporation names to gain more information about what they offer, what they require and how to join them.

> In most cases the easiest way into any corporation is to poke their CEO.
