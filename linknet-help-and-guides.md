# Guides
## [Clones](/linknet-help-and-guides/clones)
Jump clones are pods that you can leave in stations around New Eden. You are able to jump from your current location to an installed jump clone location anywhere in known space. This allows you to rapidly change your location. Jump cloning will only move your character to the jump clone location, you will need to move all assets the traditional way.

## [Overview Setup](/linknet-help-and-guides/overview)
In order to survive in EVE you will need to know where and who your enemies are. The default overview settings work for starters but as soon as you advance into areas where you will be engaging other players it will no longer be sufficient.

## Spectral Guides
The guides Spectral have to offer are also delivered in the form of mailing lists. To join a mailing list - open up your mail in-game, then at the bottom left click "Add Mailing List" and enter the name of the guide you wish to access.

# Ingame Services

## Asset Deposit
If you have some extra assets that you do not actively need or use and notice that the coalition might have use for them then you should have a look at the Asset Deposit service that we have in the coalition.

## Citadels
Upwell Structures or citadels are player-built and controlled stations with a variety of services. Currently they are still under development and have a limited amount of features but as time goes on the amount of things they are capable of will go up.

## Refining Service
May you be a miner looking to sell his/her ores in a more friendly form or a manufacturer that needs his ores to be refined in order to manufacture some fancy stuff refining is the only way to go. Training for a perfect refiner takes a long long time not to mention you need the correct facilities to max out your refining yield. To max out all refining skills for each ores takes roughly a year. This is where we will step in!

## Mining Fleets
Upon joining one of the LinkNet partner corporations or by gaining an allied status you will be given the chance to benefit from our mining boosting system.

The community has several Mining Boosters capable of boosting our miners with up to 70% efficiency and raising mining fleets almost at any given time! All of the boosters are volunteers willing to make your mining a more enjoyable and profitable experience.

## Public Blueprints
Amongst many other things LinkNet offers services for manufacturers. The primary service for manufacturers is called public BPO system. What it means in practice is that the coalition has bought a variety of original blueprints with the funds that we have made and locked them down in designated research systems. When a blueprint is locked down it means that it can be used by all the members that have the required role to view the corporation hangar but it is not possible to remove or move the BPO at all which will prevent any undesired theft.
