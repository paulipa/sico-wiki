# Wormholes Manual
This guide can also be used for solo pilots to gain a better understanding about wormhole life. You may use it also as a guide for how to do day trips to SEADC wormhole system even when you are in another SiCO corporation.

# Understanding wormhole space
The major difference between wormhole space and known space is **that there never will be a set route to take to get into a set system since there are no stargates to wormhole space.** All traffic to wormhole space is done by entering wormholes. 

While there are a set of rules that determine the destinations of the spawned systems, at this point we can just assume that there are none and a wormhole can lead to any random system in EVE. So the problem is that each time a wormhole collapses it may effect on the route that you have to take to enter in and out to our WH HQ system. In the following chapters we will go thorough the very basics of wormhole life and how to get started with it.

> **You also need to keep in mind that wormhole space security rating is always -1.0** meaning anyone and anything can hit on you and it is up to you to survive!
{.is-warning}

## Wormhole classes and difficulties
**Each wormhole system has a class (C) attached to it.** The general rule with the classes are that the higher the class the harder the sites inside the system are. And obviously the more rewarding the sites are. For a new player focusing on the low class wormholes is the way to start.

> Our Planetary Interaction hole is a low class wormhole with easier rats and connections.
{.is-info}

The easiest way to know the class of your current wormhole system is: using pathfinder!

## Wormhole effects and specialties
**Each wormhole space has its unique effect and set of rules that apply to them.** In this section we will only be focusing on the effects and rules that apply to our current wormhole class. However keep in mind that if you end up in a fight in another wormhole the effect on the wormhole might play against or for you.
![wh-effects.jpg](/wh-effects.jpg =200x)

> When you enter a system with special effects you can see the effects applied on you by hovering your mouse over the effect icon
{.is-info}

You can also hover over your mouse on pathfinder on the system to get information about the effects.

Besides of the effects each wormhole system has its own set of other rules that apply on them. For example the rule that applies on our wormhole class is that it can never had a direct known space wormhole exit spawned inside it including high sec space. This means two different things:

- When we want to get into high sec space we always have to go via another wormhole system. This is where having a low class wormhole helps since they most often have high sec statics inside them.
- There will be less traffic inside our wormhole space as most traffic inside wormhole space comes from the direct statics from known space.

The last major difference is the lack of local player list. You will never know the amount of players inside a wormhole system for sure as you only turn visible on the list if you talk on the local chat. As a new player you should always im to stay hidden thus never talk on the local chat.

> Wormhole systems has no local member list
{.is-warning}

## Static wormholes
Each wormhole system has one or more static wormholes in them. What this means is that the wormhole space will always contain wormholes that will lead to these static system types. If the old wormhole exit collapses a new one will spawn right away and lead to the system type that belonged to the collapsed static exit. The statics types are pre determined and never change.

The easiest way to determine the current static wormholes of any system is to use Pathfinder. The static systems are named in the system information window.

## Wandering wormholes
Besides the static wormholes that are always there thers is a chance to get a wandering wormhole spawn inside our system. This can happen for two reasons: the game is spawning a wandering wormhole inside our hole or someone else is spawning their own static that leads to a C4 class wormhole.

**The randomly spawning wormholes are a rare sight.** You can determine that a wormhole is a wanderer if it does not have the name of N766 or C247 on it as these are our static ID numbers.

**However if the number of the wormhole shows K162** it means that someone on the “other side” has spawned the wormhole. The wormhole may be a spawn of a old wormhole exit in a random system that has a C4 set static and we simply get lucky to get it to spawn the new on in our our hole. The second situation is that someone is doing wormhole rolling which means intentionally collapsing their own statics by moving enough mass thorough them to make it collapse.

This is usualy done to find new systems with anomalies to run, or to look for fights. We won’t get into details of wormhole rolling on this section. What you need to keep in mind that if a wormhole spawns it is very likely that there is someone else waiting on the other side and you should scout it out and get yourself to safety, at least until you know whats waiting for you on the other side.

# How to stay alive
As mentioned in the previous section wormhole space is very much different to known space. This means that you will also need to know more about EVE in order to survive and stay safe in wormhole space. The few basic in-game mechanisms that you need to know how to use are D-scanning and probe scanning. You will also need to understand how to use bookmarks and how to create safe spots.

## D-Scan
You on board scanner will be your local list inside wormhole space. Or at least as close as it can get to it. It is the only way to know if there are any undocked, undocked ships within your scan range. As you can figure out this leaves a lot of ships to be able to be hidden from your dscan and as there are no local list there is no way for you to know if there are any other players with you inside the same system.

The following video is a good guide for efficiently using D-scan: https://youtu.be/F1XwKm1FPO8

## Probe scanning
If you want to travel outside of your current wormhole system you will need to be able to do probe scanning. This is the only way to find out wormholes if they are not already bookmarked by other players.

With probe scanning you will also need to know how to use Pathfinder. The guide for pathfinderis included in here: [Pathfinder](/tools/pathfinder)

Please see the following tutorial to understand how probe scanning works: https://youtu.be/u2eZmodJvNo

There are two different types of probes, scanning probes and combat probes. As you can figure out from the name combat probes are able to scan down other ships and structures. A skilled combat prober is able to scan down you ship faster than you could think, making safespots meaningless. Luckily all probes will appear on dscan, if they are at the dscan range. This means that if you see combat probes out on dscan it is likely that someone is after your ass.

There are two ways to avoid getting combat probed. The first one is cloaking up. But remember, if the scanner did manage to scan you down before you cloaked then they can directly warp on you. The second way to avoid getting caught is to constantly move. Probes will only pinpoint your current location at a given time. This means that you are able to keep on warping to different safe spots or burning very fast on your current one. The time the prober lands on their scanned spot you have already moved.

## Warp Bubbles
Warp bubbles are anchorable or launchable AOE effects, that will prevent any warping out within them. As these bubbles can only be used in null sec and wormhole space you won’t encounter them in other areas. These bubbles will prevent you from warping and sometimes can manipulate your warp paths. Interceptors are the only ships that are able to warp out from a warp bubble which is why they are very usefull for traveling around.

Please see the following video: https://youtu.be/5-yVJCLjajo

In any other cases you will have to slow burn out of a bubble or optionally if bubbled at a gate take the gate again and jump back where you came from. Since there are no static gates in wormhole space the bubbles are almost always launched at the wormhole exits, either to prevent people from entering your wormhole system or to get so kills. It is important that you know what warp bubbles are and how to react when you land in one.

## Safe spots
Making safespots is the bread and butter for all type of life from known space to wormhole space. They are used both to avoid engagements as well as allowing you to decide the terms of engagement. In this guide we will only have a look at safe spots as a way for avoiding fights and surviving hostile territories.

Please see the following video: https://youtu.be/jyaWeHpADKY

Safe spots are created with bookmarks. This means that when you warp to a safe spot other players are unable to follow you, assuming they do not happen to have made a safe spot at the exact same location. The downside of safe spots are that if you or someone else in your corporation hasn’t made on before then there are none and you will have to create them yourself. Safe spots can be created both before any engagement as a precaution or during an engagement.

> Remember that safe spots are not 100% safe and you can be scanned down. The best option after warping to a safe spot is to make sure that there are no combat probes out and cloaking up.
{.is-warning}

The same way as you can use safe spots to hide you can use them for fighting. You can pre create safe spots around structures, gates and wormholes. This way instead of directly warping to your destination you are able to land on the grid and see whats on it before you decide to take a fight. They can also be used to avoid warp bubbles as described in the earlier section of this guide.

## Pathfinder
As we have mentioned several times before in this guide pathfinde is the program that makes it possible for us to efficiently live and travel inside wormhole space. It is 100% vital that you have set up your pathfinder correctly and are able to use it. Since pathfinder can also be used by other coalition members the guide for it is located in here: [Pathfinder](/tools/pathfinder)

## Doctrines
When we are talking about doctrinse in EVE online we are talking about ships, fits and their relations in fleet operations. Doctrines are pre-doctrined setups that are to be used in different engagements. It is very important that all players inside the corporation would be able to or would be training to fly our core doctrine ships. Reason for doctrines is that depending on the enemy, situation and purpose of the engagement the ships used may differ by a lot. If people are flying wrong type of ships compared to the majority of the fleet they are ineffective or may even harm the fleet.

The corporation and coalition has created a few basic doctrine ships that you should aim for. These ships have been designed based on our fleet numbers and pilot capabilities. All of our doctrines are visible on AUTH in here https://auth.silentcoalition.com/fleetup/doctrines/

As we are living in wormhole space it means that we will need ships that are agile, flexible and have low mass. For this reason the T3 cruisers are perfect. The downside is that they do cost quite a bit of money and take a while to train for. For this reason alone it is important that you start training for a T3 cruiser as fast as possible! The upside of the T3 are that they can be used for pretty much everything except for logistics. You can use them for solo exploration, combat site running, roaming or then do all the same things on fleet level.

If you are not into T3 cruisers then the second primary doctrine ship for our T3 fleets are T2 logistic ships. However the training for logistics is even worse than to T3 so it is most often a secondary ship that older people train for.

# Living in wormhole space
Permanently living or staging out in wormhole space comes with its ups and downs. While being a more rewarding way of playing EVE it also comes with great risk of losses and requires a higher understanding of game mechanisms. In this chapter we will go thorough the basics of living inide a wormhole.

## Access
While anyone that happens to enter our wormhole exits at any time are able to enter our wormhole space only the members of SiCO are able to see the Pathfinder map for our current exits. The same rule also applies to all of the structures that we have anchored in our wormhole system. Only the members of SiCO and their registered and blued alts are able to dock up in the structures.

To check if your non-corporated alts are able to dock up in our citadels (if they have been addedd to the access list) you can search for the wormhole system name with your people and places searc and see if any of our structures show up on the search. If they do it means that you are able to dock up.

## Asset Safety
The major difference with citadel asset safety compared to known space and wormhole space is that there are none. All of your assets stored in the citadels can be destroyed and lost/looted if the citadel is destroyed. For this very reason we highly recommend that you follow the rule number one in EVE Online: Do not fly what you can’t afford to lose. Only store items in the wormhole space that you are OK to lose if the worst scenario happens and our citadel gets destroyed.

> There is no asset safety in wormhole space
{.is-danger}

This being sed it is not likely or common for a full-scale siege on a full powered citadel. But it is not impossible either. On a full-scale siege of a strong wormhole entity there is very little we can do in terms of asset evacuation. Against any small parties we are able to defend ourselves by ships and correctly fitted citadels.

## Defense
The citadels in our wormhole are fitted with guns and ECM weapons. However the guns are only able to scare off small gangs or solo pilots. For any larger threats a fleet of defending ships are needed. For this reason it is important that all the players living in wormhole are able to fly our doctrines or training for flying them. All Defence Operators are able to man the citadel and use its weapon systems.

To take control of the citadel you will have to be docked inside it and use the take control button. The citadel defence itself works like a normal ship, except it can’t move around. Players with director roles are able to over-rule players sitting in the citadel defence operator position if needed.

## Cosmic Signatures
Wormhole space is full of cosmic signatures that can be seen by opening the probe scanner. All of the signatures have to be scanned down before you are able to warp to them. The signatures are inhabited by Sleepers, which provide the materials to build Tech 3 Ships. They also do not have any bounties on them, so all of the ISK you gain from running the sites comes from the loot that are dropped by the sleepers or the sites you are running. The so-called blue loot is a unique type of loot that is bought by NPCs. This means that the value of the sites is stable and can be further increased by salvaging.

- Gas – Gas sites contain gas that can be harvested and used for T3 production. Some of the gas sites may have some sleepers defending them so it is important to know what is waiting for you in the site before you warp to them
- Data – Data Sites will contain locked containers, containing items like datacores, which can be unlocked through Hacking. The sites are heavily guarded.
- Relic – Those sites will contain ancient relics in containers, which have to be opened through Archaeology. Ancient relics are needed to generate T3 blueprints through reverse engineering. Relic Sites are heavily guarded.
- Wormhole – Wormholes are not guarded by Sleepers, though it may be guarded by players. Unknown sites always indicate a Wormhole location, said wormhole will not spawn in its destination system until a player jumps through it. While it is by no means a guarantee, avoiding jumping wormhole signatures significantly reduces the chance that you will find yourself sharing the system with other players. It is worth noting that if a wormhole is opened towards you (your side is K162) the connection has been certainly established on both sides.

Before you warp to a signature or site you should check what you are against with. The easiest way is to use the following spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#

## Anomalies
Anomalies are cosmic signatures that do not need to be scanned down. These anomalies spawn at a random rate. There are two different type of anomalies:

- Ore sites – Are huge ore fields that can be mined down just like normal asteroid fields. Different to known space the ore anomalies can be extremely large and contain rare ores that are not found in high sec space.
- Combat sites – These sites contain sleepers that will drop blue loot. The high class wormhole sites are hard for solo pilots and you should always check the anomalies sheet for the opponents you face in them before entering the sites.

## Manufacturing
While manufacturing in wormhole space may be efficient the dangers of losing your assets in a possible siege and the difficulty of moving assets in and out might not make it so attractive. On the positive side you can manufacture anything in wormhole space, including the stuff that is forbidden in high sec space. The only thing that you are unable to build in wormhole space are super capitals as building them requires sov.

Wormhole space is most suitable for building T3 ships as you can find all the materials you need from them inside wormhole space. However keeping in mind that building T3 ships require a lot of different materials it is very likely that you will need to ship in some materials from trade hubs.

## Ship renaming
Due to the lack of local list the only way to identify incoming hostiles is by the D-scan tool. 

In order to try to separate friendly pilots from hostile pilots each ship that is used in our wormhole space has to have a standard icon in front of its name!

Copy and paste the following icon in front of your ships name: ༺༒༻

While the icon can also be copied by hostile pilots the random roaming pilots entering our system are unlikely to have them. This allows us to have some time to think about our next move when we see a new ship on dscan.

# Bookmarking & Bookmarks
Bookmarking is a crucial part of wormhole life. As pretty much everything needs to be bookmarked it is important that we have some simple rules for them. Bookmarking rules are built to work seamlessly with Pathfinder so its important that you know how to use Pathfinder as well.

## Naming bookmarks
Bookmarking is a crucial part of living in wormhole space. Since it takes a lot of bookmarks to mark every single exit and anomalies we have a set of rules that apply to bookmarking. Bookmarking rules are built to work with Pathfinder so it is important that you understand how to use the program before you can start making bookmarks. All corporation members are able to add and delete bookmarks.

Bookmark names should always start with the three letters that are present in the signature ID. This way we can connect the bookmark to the  correct ID and remove them from bookmarks as the signature vanishes. For a example guide for creating bookmarks to wormhole chains can be found from the Pathfinder guide in here: https://www.silentcoalition.com/help-center/pathfinder

Bookmarks always start with the signature id letters followed by:

- For wormholes: XXX -> System the wormhole leads to (ABC -> C2, ABC -> Amarr, ABC -> J123465)
- For other signatures such as data sites: You can simply save the site via your probe launcher and it will automatically save it as ABC-123 Name Of The Site (ie. HQH-091 Ordinary Perimeter Reservoir)

## Saving Bookmarks
Bookmarks are always saved in the correct folders under corporation bookmarks. There are different type of folders to make it easier to categorize different bookmarks.

- ⓦ Wormhole – All wormhole exits
- Ⓢ Signatures – All signatures including anomalies and other cosmic signatures than wormholes
- ⓈⓈ Safespots – All safe spots
- ⓒ Citadels & POS – POS bookmarks and citadel bookmarks
- Ⓓ Docking – Docking bookmarks such as insta docks, undocks and citadel docking bookmarks
- Ⓒ Custom member marks – All other bookmarks

Bookmarks should always be stored inside a folder instead of right to the corporation bookmarks.  The only exception is when you are in a real hurry to create them. If you do this please delete or clean up when the situation calms down.

## Deleting Bookmarks
When signatures vanish the bookmarks needs to be cleaned up. To clean up bookmarks simply check if the probe scanner has a signature with the ID of the bookmark. If not, delete the bookmark by right clicking it and press delete. All members are able to delete bookmarks so make sure you don’t delete active bookmarks in mistake. Most often only wormhole and signature bookmarks needs to be deleted.

# Thera system
A special system exist in the Anoikis galaxy that behaves somewhat inbetween a known-space system and a shattered wormhole system. 

Thera is the only j-space system that has NPC stations in which you can install a medical clone or utilize normal jump clone mechanics. Although it is considered a huge PVP subcap arena (solar system diameter ~ 342AU), it is also a great travelling hub due to its increased wormhole connectivity (9 k-space statics + additional wandering/k162 wormholes ).

For the purpose of navigating in/out of Thera, you can use a public bookmark folder that is available courtesy of a group of players that dedicated themselves to scanning the connections and maintaining said folder ( https://www.eve-scout.com/ ). In order to get access, you need to join the ingame channel : "EVE-SCOUT" , and afterwards online the folder from the channel MOTD (message of the day).

> Remember to always check the wormhole size/ship mass jump limit, if you are flying anything bigger than a destroyer.
