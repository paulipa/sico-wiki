# SICO Incursions

# FAQ
## Q: What are Vanguard Incursions?
A: Incursions in eve are high-difficulty group PvE content, with the goal of making ISK. There are several “tiers” of Incursion sites, with varying payouts, required fleet sizes and sites. We run Vanguard sites, which require fleets of 10-12 pilots.

## Q: What ships can I bring?
A: Our VG doctrine fits can be found here: https://wiki.silentcoalition.com/en/community/doctrines#incursions-vanguards

## Q: Can I make changes to my fit?
A: In short, no. A lot of careful consideration and optimisation has gone into developing our doctrine, and seemingly small changes can lead to a ship that is not fit to fulfil its role and may struggle to survive encounters (or even endanger the fleet!). The obvious exception are direct upgrades, like using T2 guns or faction damage mods.

## Q: Where do I need to go?
A: You can see scheduled fleets here: https://auth.silentcoalition.com/optimer/ . Make sure you are in the Incursion special interest group, and you will find a ping at the scheduled time in the incursion channel on discord. X up when the fleet is starting to form, and you will be invited to fleet! The current incursion dockup will always be pinned in that channel, so make sure you are in the correct location before X’ing up. 

## Q: How much money does the fleet make?
A: In a normal fleet, you can expect to make over 100 million ISK per hour (per pilot), the current fleet record sits at 111 mil/h. Fleets usually last for 3-4 hours, but you are free to drop out at any time.

## Q: What are the requirements?
A: You need to be able to fly an exact doctrine fit, buy and bring your own ship, and be able to join discord voice comms (mic not required, but encouraged). You also must have completed an MQP fleet.

## Q: Will I even get into fleet with a starter fit?
A:  Yes. The payout mechanic dictates a maximum number of ships we can bring, so critical roles must be filled by appropriate ships no matter what. After these roles are filled, however, the remaining spots are filled in the order in which pilots X’d up, not by how good their fits are.

# Checklist BEFORE joining your first Vanguard fleet:
- Read through this guide, start to finish
- Join an MQP fleet to learn how fleets move and operate, and how to utilize broadcasts
- Make sure your fit is identical to the most recent doctrine fit
- Make sure you are in the current dockup system
- Set up a new overview tab for incursions, using this guide: https://streamable.com/ycx1qv
- Set up color-coded broadcasts, using this guide: https://streamable.com/thb6ab
- You need to be in a fleet to do this. R-click your own name -> “Form Fleet with..”

# Checklist when joining fleet/undocking:
- Safety set to green
- Shield hardeners / Sensor boosters / Tracking computers online + active
- Fleet History window open and ready for broadcasts
- Incursion overview tab active

# How do Incursions actually work?
Incursions are based on sites, which spawn in the systems currently under invasion by sansha forces. Anyone can warp to these sites, and they will respawn shortly after completion for as long as the incursion focus lasts. The basic concept is for combat ships to clear each site of hostiles, while logistics ships “heal” fleet members to counter the massive incoming damage. An individual ISK and LP payout is issued to each pilot upon completion of a site automatically. The combat ship role is separated into two classes; Snipers and DPS. Target priority is communicated to the fleet by using tags, more about their usage below.

# General Notes
Incoming damage is very high in Vanguard sites, so logistics ships only have a window of a few seconds to get reps on you and save your ship when you are getting shot at. It is vital that you broadcast for shields as soon as you are getting targeted by hostiles, so logi have enough time to react. For the same reason, you must turn on your shield hardeners as soon as you undock, and keep them running for the duration of the fleet. The FC might remind you to do it, but it is your own responsibility. Do not forget to do this, logi can not help you if your hardeners are off and you will lose your ship. Snipers Nightmare and Praxis are the sniper fits in our VG doctrine. They are the main source of damage in a fleet, as they can project their damage to ranges of 60km and beyond. Primary targets for snipers are tagged with the letters A,B,C. The kill order for a sniper ship is therefore:

## Snipers
Nightmare and Praxis are the sniper fits in our VG doctrine. They are the main source of damage in a fleet, as they can project their damage to ranges of 60km and beyond. Primary targets for snipers are tagged with the letters A,B,C. The kill order for a sniper ship is therefore:

`A → B → C → 1 → 2 → 3`
> A major exception to this rule are the Niarja Myelen. These are highest priority for snipers whenever they spawn. In Addition to this, targets tagged ‘X’ must NOT be killed.

## DPS
Vindicator, Hyperion and Rokh are the DPS fits in our VG doctrine. With short range blasters, their main objective is to use their webs to slow small, fast frigate targets and kill them. Primary targets for DPS are tagged with the numbers 1,2,3. The kill order for a DPS ship is therefore:

`1 → 2 → 3 → A → B → C`

> In Addition to this, targets tagged ‘X’ must NOT be killed.

In Summary: know the tags assigned to your role, and work through them in order. Listen out for FC calls, that always has priority over tags. Feel free to ask questions during the fleet if you are ever unsure about something, we are happy to help…your success is our success, after all!
