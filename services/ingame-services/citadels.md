# Citadels
Upwell Structures or citadels are player-built and controlled stations with a variety of services. Currently they are still under development and have a limited amount of features but as time goes on the amount of things they are capable of will go up.

Silent Coalition offers a variety of different citadels for your use depending on your operating locations. All of these structures are designed to improve your quality of gaming and provide you safe places to stage from.

## Accessing a Citadel
Citadel access is determined by an Access list (ACL) that is created by the access list admins. It is possible to add or block access and usage for the individual citadel services from single players to large alliances.

Only the players who have been granted either ACL manager role or admin role are able to see the lists and alter them. Currently these admins are the same players that are sitting in wing director positions for the Silent Coalition.

The coalition leadership will make sure that all the coalition members and blue players have acess to the citadels and structures we own as well as use the services installed on them.

> As long as you are part of any Silent Coalition corporation you will have access to the coalition wide citadels.

## Finding your citadels

If you have been granted access to dock in a citadel there are a few ways to locate them. The easiest way to find a citadel is to use your overview. 

### Overview

If you have the correct [overview settings](/services/guides/overview) with citadels visible on them you will be able to see the citadel like any stations on your overview. The citadels you can dock at have a small arrow on them pointing inwards.

### Structure browser
You are also able to use the structure browser which can be found from your neocom menu under `Social -> Structure Browser`. With this browser you are able to locate all the structure within the search range that you have docking access to!

You can only search as wide as a region at this moment with the browser so that means you are not able to know about any citadels outside your current region without knowing from other sources that there are some citadels located in other regions.

### Locations channel
The public citadels we have are also linked in the locations channel. See [ingame channels.](/tools/communication/ingame-channels)
