# Blueprint system
Amongst many other things the Silent Coalition offers services for manufacturers. The primary service for manufacturers is called public BPO system. What it means in practice is that the coalition has bought a variety of original blueprints with the funds that we have made and locked them down in designated research systems. When a blueprint is locked down it means that it can be used by all the members that have the required role to view the corporation hangar but it is not possible to remove or move the BPO at all which will prevent any undesired theft.

All the original blueprints that are locked down in our research locations are completely free for our members to use. Making copies of the originals for selling them onward always comes as the lowest priority in case the original blueprint is needed for something else such as manufacturing items to be sold on local market. Directors and the CEO are able to cancel any research or manufacturing job in case there is ever a need for it.

As there is no such thing as alliance or public hangars in EVE the only way the BPOs can be made as public as possible is to store them inside a corporation hangar. Since it is possible that some corporations may have blueprints that the other corporations doesn’t we have created a web store for ordering copies from other corporations or if you lack the roles to make the copies yourself.

> The primary blueprint system is located in SEADC corporation. You may request a transfer to the corporation, see changing corporations at the [corporations](/community/members) section

## Where are the blueprints located and how do i access them? 
Most of the blueprints that we have available in the system are stored in our research station in on high sec HQ. You can find the exact location for the blueprints by browsing the blueprint market on the website.

## Accessing the blueprints 
Usually the first requirement for accessing the blueprints is to be in the corporation that owns the blueprints or have an alt inside of it. Once you meet this criteria you will need a Member title or higher to gain access to the industrial hangar.

After you have the access to the blueprints you either have to be at the system where the blueprints are stored or have enough levels in Scientific Networking skill, which allows you to install jobs from remote locations. Each level of this skill allows you to install a job that is 5 jumps out (shortest route) with a maximum install range of 25 jumps on level 5. Once you meet all of the previous requirements you can start to use the blueprint

> Accessing blueprints in SEADC requires you to complete your [Member Qualification Program](/services/programs/mqp)

## What blueprints we have? 
There is two ways for you to find out what blueprints we have in the system. The easiest way is to use the industry window. Optionally you can fly to the blueprint citadel and check the blueprints directly from the hangar.

### In-game Industry Window 
When you get the Member title (or higher) you also get the permission to view the blueprints that are currently located in those corporation hangars that your personal roles allows you to see. To get started open the industrial window in-game (ALT + S).
![industry-window-649x400.jpg](/industry-window-649x400.jpg =400x)

Once you have opened the industrial window you have to select the correct filters to see the blueprints that belong to the BPO Library system.

- Make sure you are showing all blueprints (also those currently in use by someone else)
- Select blueprints owned by corporation
- Select the research station, all public blueprints are located in the research stations even if you could see other stations in the list
- Select hangar (you can only see the hangars you can access) Select the industrial hangar as all public BPOs ready for use are in here
- Select the type. If you are looking only for originals you can select “originals” in here
- Set group to all (if you are looking only for specific types of prints like capital construction parts then select the correct group for them)

### Market Service 
You can also browse the market service located on our homepage at https://www.silentcoalition.com/shop/ to see all of the blueprints in the different corporations.

If you are unable to access the BPOs that you need you can always order a copy of them by simply using the website shop!

## How to use the blueprints 
All the corporation public blueprints are locked down witch means that you are able to install jobs such as copying or researching but you are not able to remove or move the original blueprints from the hangar. 

Once you are at the research station or have enough levels in Scientific Networking to install jobs remotely simply double click on the blueprint you wish to use (if you have the manufacturing window open) or right click the blueprint in the hangar and select use blueprint (if you are accessing the blueprints from your local station hangar) and all the different things that you can select and do with that BPO will open up on top of the manufacturing window. 

When using corporation blueprints make sure you use the follow the instructions in the picture bellow:

### Making Copies
To use the blueprints you either have to bring the materials to the same location where the original blueprint is locked down (capital BPOS only) at or make a copy of the blueprint (blueprints inside containers). Since the copies are a lot easier to be moved than the tons of materials that you might need, not to mention the bonuses for manufacturing that you might get from manufacturing them at different locations it is always recommended to create a copy of the original blueprints.

Whenever creating copies from the blueprints that are located inside the containers make sure that you set your output location to a different place! All items that are in these containers will be locked and you will need a Director to move them out for you.

### Manufacturing
You can also obviously manufacture (build) items also from the blueprints. However since most of the blueprints are located inside small containers that do not allow you to take any items out from the containers you always need to create copies of the blueprints before you can start to manufacture them

To start a manufacturing job is pretty much similar for copying, with the exception that you need the minerals in the station with the blueprint.

> It is recommended that you make a copy of a blueprint and build from the copy inside your own hangar instead of using the original blueprints directly.

### Researching
Researching original blueprints takes a lot of time. To research a capital BPO from level 0 to perfect takes close to a year. As a character can only research a maximum of 11 BPOs at same time with maximum skills you can help out the corporation by researching those blueprints that are not yet on perfect level! Most of the +6 month research is done by the corporation dedicated characters so you do not have to worry about locking all of your research slots for researching BPOs for months and months.

Simple if you have time and do not need your current research slots for anything pick a random corporation BPO located in the industry hangar and do some ME and TE research on it. If all of our members does this even with low skills we can have plenty of perfect blueprints after a while and that will again help out the players who want to copy and use the blueprints.

To find out what blueprints needs to be researched open the manufacturing window once again and seek for the available corporation blueprints located in our research station the same way as explained earlier in this guide. Then simply look at the columns and install any jobs that does not have the ME or TE bar at full blue.

## Following the progress and delivering the job 
You can follow the progress of your jobs and the jobs are installed by other corporation members from the public blueprints from the manufacturing window (alt + s) or from the BPO Library page. Navigate to the jobs tab on the manufacturing window and select the correct settings.
![corporation-jobs-649x400.jpg](/corporation-jobs-649x400.jpg =300x)

Once the job is completed a delivery button will will appear to the status column of this window. Once your job is done deliver it as fast as possible so that they do not start to stack up. When you click on the deliver button your job will be delivered to the hangar you selected for it when you installed the job! If you did ME or TE research then the BPO will stay in the industrial hangar as they are locked down.

> Be aware that anyone is able to complete your jobs and take the manufactured items out from the hangar. For this reason building from a copy in your own hangar is the best way

## Contributing and gaining 
Since the coalition is not able to buy all of the BPOs that exists in EVE we have a system for our members to contribute as well as gain for themselves. If you have original blueprints in your personal hangar that you do not regularly use you can deposit them for the corporation! While they are deposited in to the corporation and locked down to prevent any theft there is a high chance that other players will also research your BPOs. If you at some point want to withdraw them back you get researched blueprints for free.

To find out more about the asset deposit system have a look at the [Asset deposit system](/services/ingame-services/asset-deposit)

# Printer group
The coalition offers free copies via the online store for those members who are unable to access the blueprints in the game. 

As it takes a lot of time and slots to fill up all the copy orders the coalition has a department role called `printers` for those players who would like to volunteer to help us copy the blueprints for other members.

In order to join the group please sign up for the role on AUTH groups page https://auth.silentcoalition.com/groups/

> You will need to have an alt in SEADC and have completed the [MQP](/services/programs/mqp) to qualify for the printer group.
