# Asset Deposit system
If you have some extra assets that you do not actively need or use and notice that the coalition might have use for them then you should have a look at the Asset Deposit service that we have in the coalition. 

Time to time as the coalition expands we find ourselves in situations where buying new assets is not the most optimal thing to do. For example when expanding our mining boost to a system where a coalition player already has an booster ship that he does not use.

## What is the CAD ?
The Coalition Asset Deposit (CaD) system is a simple system that will keep track on all of the assets that are “borrowed” to the coalition. When you provide your assets for the coalition to be used we will log it up so that when you want your assets back we are able to return it to the correct owner. 

The second function for the CAD system is that it allows us to receive the items faster when compared to a situation where we would need to gain the funds for the item and then purchase it. Once the coalition has enough funds it is able to purchase your deposited item from you and change the ownership of the item to the coalition.

## Why should I use CAD
By lending your personal items to the coalition you help us to provide better services even faster for all of our members. In other words when you use the CAD service you and your deposited assets will become a concrete part of the coalition. If for some reason you want your assets back before the coalition can afford to buy it from you then we can easily return them for you.

### Examples: 

`Blueprints` : If you have Original blueprints that you are not constantly using you can deposit them to the coalition. This will both benefit you and the other coalition members as they use the public bpo service. When your personal BPOs are deposited to the coalition they wil be added to the public BPO system. This way the other coalition members are able to do either material or time research on it or use it for making copies. If at some point you need the BPO back to your personal use you may receive a better BPO than you deposited and our coalition members might have got some free copies of it.

## How to use CAD?
Using the system is extremely simple. If you have assets such as BPOs or control towers we prefer that you have them located in the system that will be their final location when contracting them over to the CAD system.

For example the BPOs deposited should be located in our BPO research station and the POS tower in the location where you want to have it anchored. If you are not sure about the final location and are able to haul it by yourself do not hesitate to ask for the correct location. If you are unable to move the assets by yourself then we will move them for you.

1. Create an item exchange contract to the coalition executor `Ikarus Cesaille`
2. Add description: CAD to the contract and leave all prices to 0. 
> 	You must add the description CAD on the contract. This is the only way for us to know it is a CAD contract and not a donation.

3. When a officer accepts your contract he will log it in to the CAD system.

## Coalition purchase
When the coalition has enough funds and if it seems that it is important that your items ownership belongs to the coalition we will contact you about purchasing the item from you. The prices are negotiable but should move around jita sell prices. If for some reason you are not willing to sell your items to the coalition we might ask you to take it out from the CAD system.

## Getting your items back
When your items are not bought from you by the coalition and you want them back you can simply request them from the coalition. The fastest way to do this is to directly contact the CEO with an in-game mail. Your item will be contracted back to you as soon as possible and the entry will be removed from the CAD system. If the coalition has great need for your asset we most likely offer to buy the item off you.
