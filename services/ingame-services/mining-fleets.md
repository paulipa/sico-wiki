# Mining Fleets
Upon joining one of the LinkNet partner corporations or by gaining an allied status you will be given the chance to benefit from our mining boosting system. 

The community has several Mining Boosters capable of boosting our miners with up to 70% efficiency and raising mining fleets almost at any given time! All of the boosters are volunteers willing to make your mining a more enjoyable and profitable experience.

## What is boosting and how does it work?
Boosters in EVE (known as buffers in some MMOS) are players who are flying ships that are capable of fitting and using command burst modules. There are two different types of command bursts: mining and warfare. When loaded with ammunition these modules are able to increase the stats of the other players. In order for the other players to receive the boost two conditions will need to be filled: the players must be in the same fleet and they must be within the range of the command burst.

> Command burst modules do not stack. For this reason only the strongest boost of each kind in fleet counts if there are several boosters on the same are of effect

## Fleet system
The fleeting system in EVE is a game mechanism that makes it easier to maneuver several players at the same time, provide fleet broadcasts and boost the other fleet members. Fleets can be created at any time for any reason by any pilots. Different settings are used to allow different access types for other players to the fleet.

A fleet can only have one boss who determines he access settings and is able to change the MOTD message of the fleet. Besides the boss there can be several players in commander positions that are able to manipulate the players below them.

## Fleet hierarchy
A fleet has three different layers in it but not all of them have to be used. One fleet can hold up to 256 pilots. On top of the fleet layers is the fleet commander (fleet) position. Below the fleet commander there can be up to 5 different wing commanders (wings). Again under each wing there can be up to 5 different squad commanders (squads) while each of these squads holds unlimited amount of players, up to the fleets maximum capacity. Each of the players holding a commander position is able to maneuver all of the members below themselves. This means that the fleet commander is able to warp the whole fleet of 256 players at same time while the wing commanders are able to warp only a total of 51 pilots (all the players in the 5 squads below him + him/herself).

When creating a new fleet the fleet only contains the minimum setup to host one squad of members which is: One fleet commander, one wing commander and one squad commander the member squad. The player holding the fleet boss status is able to create more wings and squads if needed.

# LINE Mining Fleets
LinkNet mining fleets have a standard setup so that it is easy for you to get into them and understand where and how they are operating.

## What Boost am I getting?
The type of boost and its efficiency depends on the modules fitted on the boosting ship and the skill level of the booster. While most of the official Industry Commanders are all using our standard boosting fit and have the best possible skills for boosting you need to keep in mind that as it takes a long time to train up all of the boosting skills some of the boosters might not have yet the time to max all of their skills.

While in a LINE Mining fleet you will be receiving the following boost:
- `Mining Laser Field Enhancement` – Increases range of mining lasers, strip miners, ice harvesters, gas harvesters, and survey scanners – Maximum Bonus +114.26%
- `Mining Laser Optimization` – Reduces cycle time and capacitor use of mining lasers, strip miners, ice harvesters, and gas harvesters – Maximum Bonus -57.13%
- `Mining Equipment Preservation` – Reduces volatility of mining crystals (the speed they break down) – Maximum Bonus -57.13%

## How to join the LINE Mining fleet
There are three different ways for you to join a fleet. In order for you to be able to see and join a fleet without someone inviting you to it you will need to match the criteria set by the fleet boss. Since all the Industry Commanders in Silent Coalition have all of the community partner corporations (and the members in these corporations) set to be able to access and see the fleets by default there should be no problems for you to see any of the mining fleets, if there are any online.

### Using Fleet Finder
The easiest way for you to see any fleets available for you is to use the fleet finder window. You can only see the fleets that you are able to join by yourself in this window. If the fleet boss has incorrect settings or you are not on their “access list” for some reason there might be a fleet up and you would not see it in here.

1. Click on the E on top of your Neocom or press §
2. Hover over Social
3. Click Fleet
4. Navigate to the fleet finder tab (you are here as default)
5. Check for fleets that are named LINE Standing Mining (official coalition mining fleets)
![fleet-search.jpg](/fleet-search.jpg =300x)

### Using Fleet Links
Sometimes the mining fleet may be linked in the LinkNet General channel MOTD. People may also drag and drop the fleet advert from the fleet finder window to chat channels to create direct links to the fleets. When you click on these links you will automatically join the fleet but only if you meet the set requirements (aka. you would see the fleet yourself on the fleet finder).

### Direct Invite
The only way for you to join a fleet that you can’t see in the fleet finder is for someone to directly invite you to it. Each player in the fleet is able to invite players directly in to the positions below their own position. The easiest way for a commander to do this is to drag and drop the name of the player from a chat window to the desired position. When you receive a direct invite a pop-up window will appear. You only have 120 seconds to accept this invitation or the invitation expires. The pop-up will remain on your screen until you close it or try to accept it but if the invitation has expired you will not be able to join the fleet.

## How to receive the boost and find your fleet
Once you have joined a fleet a new chat window and a fleet window will open. You will be using these windows to move yourself to the locations where the fleet is at and to receive the mining boost.

In most LINE Mining fleets the booster is sitting in the highest possible position and is holding the boss start for the fleet. Since the booster has to be located where the mining is happening the easiest way to find your fleet members is to right click on the fleet commander in the fleet window and pressing warp to member.

If the mining fleet is not operating inside the same solar system that you are currently located you will need to move to the solar system before being able to warp on the booster! Most of the LINE fleets operates in Ronne or Jarkkolen as long as there is ores to be mined.

After landing on the fleet you can start mining while remaining inside the range of the command burst ship. The best way to do this is to keep orbiting the command ship at range. Each minute the ship will send out an area of effect burst that will boost your mining attributes. Once your ore hold is full you simply empty it and repeat the steps.

> All miners who are on the mining fleets should be on voice comms! This is to alert them for incoming gankers or criminals in space.
{.is-warning}

Using our [buyback system](/tools/buyback) is the fastest and almost always the most profitable way of selling your ores

## No fleets online: Asking for a fleet
There are a few places where you can ask for people to raise mining fleets in case there are none online (aka. Visible on the fleet finder). You should always first seek to find fleets within the coalition and only after that fleets that are raised by our allied players.

### Discord
The ultimately best way to ask `mining boosters` to raise fleets is to do it in discord. 

Discord is a third party chat and voice program which allows you to contact all those boosters that are not currently online but would otherwise be able to set up a fleet for you!
![ping-commander-800x222.jpg](/ping-commander-800x222.jpg =400x)

After registering and authenticating on [discord](/tools/communication/discord) you simply type `@imining booster` in the #linknet-general chat channel and ask them if anyone would be able to set up a fleet. Only ask once a while and never spam it in case no one is answering to you.

### LinkNet General chat
If you do not want to use discord for some reason or happen to see a Industry Commander online in LinkNet General you can try to ask in there for them to raise a fleet. However the disadvantage in this compared to discord is that the players holding the role are not getting a notification for this and the message could easily scroll away. The second downside is that the players might be simply AFK or doing something else on some other accounts.

## Ship Replacement Request 
Sometimes you lose your ship and that is perfectly normal in EVE. To try to avoid this you should follow the guidelines we have set in here for the standard mining fleet:
- Do not AFK mine
- Be on voice comms
- Use the doctrine Venture, Procurer, Skiff or Orca with proper fitting
- Warp out when you see a lot of bad standing players log in or when they are reported for warping in
- Mine at the official fleet location

If despite these steps you lose your ship to a very well organized gank, then it is not your fault. In situations like this you can request for SRP.

> Mining SRP covers losses for ganks in high sec space at the official LINE mining fleet location for players who are in the mining fleet.
{.is-info}

To get SRP you will need to ask your fleet commander (taken that its an official SiCO Mining fleet with a proper booster as the boss) to create you a SRP link.

## Belt Tracking
Once a normal asteroid belt has been mined empty you can use the belt tracking tool found on AUTH to update the status https://auth.eve-linknet.com/belttracker/

When you find an empty belt or if you mine the belt clean simply find the correct belt on the program and press on the clear button. This will change the belt status to red so that other miners do not need to check it after you.

All statuses will reset to green on downtime as the belts regenerates.

# Standard LinkNet Public Mining Fleet | Guide for Mining Boosters
The goal of our public mining fleets is to open up our communities mining services for both our community members and to the rest of EVE. Anyone will be able to join the mining fleet but only LinkNet members will benefit from all of the services.

Each day after downtime we will try to set up a mining fleet that would last until the next downtime. The first mining booster to set up to fleet doesn’t have to stay in the fleet for the whole day as the idea is to pass down the boss role when you have to log off.
- Setup a mining fleet based on the settings described on the following sections
- As the boss you can mine, boost, or AFK in station as long as you keep up the fleet advert.
- When you need to go (aka. the fleet advert will drop) you ask another booster to take over the fleet and give them the boss status.

## Who can raise LN Mining fleets
To raise an official LN Mining fleet you need to hold a mining booster role (or another fleet commander role). You can apply for the mining booster role at the auth groups section in here https://auth.eve-linknet.com.com/groups/

## Setting up a mining fleet
1. Open the agency window and navigate to the fleet up tab

After copying the text your MOTD should look something like this:

You may also add other information to the MOTD that you see fit.

## While in fleet
Operating in the mining fleet depends on how active you want to be as a mining booster. While some boosters like to have active hauling or even practice buying ores at the fields some boosters simply want to AFK boost.

> All miners who are on the mining fleets should be on voice comms! This is to alert them for incoming gankers or criminals in space.
{.is-warning}

## How to generate SRP link
To generate the SRP link you need to have the mining booster role. See the guide for creating SRP links: [Generating SRP links](/tools/auth)

## After the fleet
> If you are about to log out make sure to try to pass down the boss role for another mining booster. This way the same single fleet you created hopefully after downtime will remain up until the next downtime.
{.is-danger}

This way all players who wish to mine always know what fleet to join and what to do when in the fleet!

# LINE fundraising fleets
Any player with the mining booster role is able to raise coalition fund raising fleets. The income from these fleets will be used to support other coalition programs such as the capital ship program.

To raise a fleet:
1. Schedule a fleet via the AUTH fleet operations section. Guide located in here https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#scheduling-fleets
1. Once the fleet goes live ping the mining SIG with the ping tool https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/tools/auth#discord-fleet-pings
1. Dedicate a hauler and have it gather all the ores
1. Contract the ores over via buyback using 100% donation level
