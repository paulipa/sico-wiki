# Dealing With Triglavian Invasion Systems
Systems in minor victory or EDENCOM Fotress stage will have both invasion sites spawning in them as well as **very strong Edencom or Triglavian NPCs patrolling the system** depending on in whos favor the minor victory is. If a system has become a minor victory for Triglavians then Triglavian fleets will patrol the gates and the stations in the system.

> The patrolling NPC forces are extremely strong and deadly and will kill you in high sec space without any warning. Your standing towards EDENCOM and Triglavians will determine who will engage on you.

## Effect of standings
Your personall standings with EDENCOM and Triglavians will determine who will shoot at you in these systems.

The NPC forces and the static gun structures in these systems are extremely dangerous and they do also scram you down. If you end up in a system with negative standings towards the victory entity it is likely that you will die if you cross paths with the patrols.

The less standing you have the easier it is for you to change sides. If you are not actively taking part in triglavian invasion content then the best thing to do is to keep your positive standing only a tiny bit over positive for the entity that you want to keep from shooting at you (around +0.0001 standings and -0.0001 standing for the other entity that will shoot at you). By doing this all you need to do to change sides is to kill 1 or 2 ships from the other entity to change your side.

**To check your standings** open: Character sheet -> Interactions -> Standings. If you have never shot any EDENCOM or Triglavian entities before you will not have any standings with either side and they will not show up on the standings sheet.

### No standings
Case only applies with true no standings (factions not visible on your standings tab)
- EDENCOM forces will not shoot at you
- Triglavian forces will engage on you even in high sec space

### Positive standing with EDENCOM
If you have even a tiny bit of standing towards EDENCOM such as +0.0001 means that your standing with Triglavians will be negative.
- EDENCOM forces will not shoot at you
- Triglavian forces will engage on you even in high sec space

### Positive standing with Triglavians
If you have even a tiny bit of standing towards Triglavians such as +0.0001 means that your standing with EDENCOM will be negative
- EDENCOM forces will engage on you even in high sec space systems
- Triglavian forces will not engage on you

## Identifying and avoiding invaded systems
> There are no warnings when you are about to jump into an invaded system. For this reason it is important that you know where they are and how to avoid them.

To find out where the invaded systems are located open your ingame map (F10) and click on the filters tab and select the entities you want to avoid.

When you are traveling in high sec space without autopilot you need to know where these systems are and what your standings towards the entities are to not get killed in the systems.

> You can set your autopilot to avoid these systems by opening your autopilot settings and selecting to avoid these systems.

## How to gain standings with Triglavians for the first time

1. Use an empty clone. If you die the NPCs will destroy your pod.
2. Buy a SoE fit destroyer that matches the region you are in. This matters since the Edencom NPC you shoot always spawn according to the empire region you are in and when you pick the right ship you can kill the frigate in a destroyer. For example if you are in Amarr space pick up the Amarr destroyer. Open your fitting window and select community fittings to find the fittings
3. Locate a system that has a Minor Victory status. A good site to see these is here - https://kybernaut.space
4. Open your probe scanner window and look for a EDENCOM Forward Post. These are the easiest sites that spawn in the system.

5. Warp to the site and approach the frigate class ship. They will not shoot at you as you should be neutral to them currently
6. Set your orbit around the frigate and kill it. You must kill the frigate or otherwise the standings wont take effect. As long as you have done damage on the ship you will gain standings from the kill so you can also do the sites in a group.

7. After you have killed the frigate warp out. You only need to kill one single ship. If possible warp to a upwell structure and tether up to avoid roaming NPCs
8. You will now need to wait 20 minutes for the ratting tick. Once this tick happens you will receive a notification that your standing with EDENCOM has decreased and increased with Triglavians.
9. Warp to a triglavian site from your probe scanner to make sure you are now neutral to them and they are not shooting at you.
10. You can now travel thorough Triglavian minor victory systems without getting killed at the gates.

## Changing sides
To change sides repeat the steps above for the forces you want to change for. Depending on your current standing you may need to kill more than one ship.

If you have a lot of standings to grind then it may be a better idea to join proper fleets for either EDENCOM or Triglavians.
