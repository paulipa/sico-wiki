# Dealing With Triglavian Invasion Systems

> Please be aware that the triglavian invasions may change at any time as there is not much information about it out yet!
{.is-danger}

## Minor victory systems
Systems in minor victory stage for either to Edencom or to Triglavians will have both invasion sites spawning in them as well as very strong Edencom or Triglavian NPCs patrolling the system depending on in whos favor the minor victory is. If a system has become a minor victory for Triglavians then Triglavian fleets will patrol the gates and the stations in the system.
Invasions may happen again in systems that have already turned into minor victory systems. During the new invasion the system minor victory status may change to the opposing entity. A previously triglavian minor victory system can become a minor victory for Edencom if it is pushed for their favor.

## Effect of standings
> It is possible to keep both Triglavians and the Edencom NPC neutral to you so that you can travel via minor victory systems regardless of to whom the victory has gone. 
{.is-success}

In order to do so you will need to have Edencom standing between -0.001 and -0.99 and the standing for Triglavians on the positive side.

Edencom ships wont engage on you as long as your standing remains above -1 for them.

If you are not looking to participate in the invasions or you have hauling alts then this is the guide for you.

## Make them stop shoot at you
A work-around for folks that want/need to move through Trig/EDENCOM Minor Victory systems, but arenâ€™t participating in the invasion.
1.  Use an empty clone. If you die the NPCs will destroy your pod.
2. Buy a SoE fit destroyer that matches the region you are in. This matters since the Edencom NPC you shoot always spawn according to the empire region you are in and when you pick the right ship you can kill the frigate in a destroyer. Open your fitting window and select community fittings to find the fittings
3. Locate a system that has a Triglavian minor victory status. A good site to see these is here - https://kybernaut.space
4. Open your probe scanner window and look for a EDENCOM Forward Post. These are the easiest sites that spawn in the system.

5. Warp to the site and approach the frigate class ship. They will not shoot at you as you should be neutral to them currently
6. Set your orbit around the frigate and kill it. You must kill the frigate or otherwise the standings wont take effect. As long as you have done damage on the ship you will gain standings from the kill so you can also do the sites in a group.

7. After you have killed the frigate warp out. You only need to kill one single ship. If possible warp to a upwell structure and tether up to avoid roaming NPCs
8. You will now need to wait 20 minutes for the ratting tick. Once this tick happens you will receive a notification that your standing with EDENCOM has decreased and increased with Triglavians.
9. Warp to a triglavian site from your probe scanner to make sure you are now neutral to them and they are not shooting at you. Repeat this with an EDENCOm site.
10. You can now travel thorough minor victory systems without getting killed at the gates.
