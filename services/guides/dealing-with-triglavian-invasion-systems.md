# Dealing With Triglavian Invasion Systems

> Please be aware that this mechanism has changed on 11 august 2020: EDENCOM NPCs will now be hostile to players which have any negative standing with them.
{.is-danger}

## Minor victory systems
Systems in minor victory stage for either to Edencom or to Triglavians will have both invasion sites spawning in them as well as very strong Edencom or Triglavian NPCs patrolling the system depending on in whos favor the minor victory is. If a system has become a minor victory for Triglavians then Triglavian fleets will patrol the gates and the stations in the system.

Invasions may happen again in systems that have already turned into minor victory systems. During the new invasion the system minor victory status may change to the opposing entity. A previously triglavian minor victory system can become a minor victory for Edencom if it is pushed for their favor.

## Effect of standings
> Your standings towards EDENCOM and Triglavians will determine if they will shoot at you in the invaded systems or not. The side you have positive standings with will not shoot at you unless you engage on them.
{.is-success}

If you have positive standing with Triglavians then the patrolling triglavian ships in the invaded systems will not shoot at you. The EDENCOM ships in the EDENCOM sites will engage on you. If you again enter an EDENCOM victory system that has EDENCOM ships patrolling the gates with negative standings for EDENCOM you will get shot by the EDENCOM forces.

As minor victory systems may change from triglavian vicroty to EDENCOM victory if they are invaded again it means that depending on your operating locations you may want to change sides.

The less standing you have the easier it is for you to change sides. If you are not actively taking part in triglavian invasion content then the best thing to do is to keep your positive standing only a tiny bit over positive for the entity that you want to keep from shooting at you (around +0.0001 standings and -0.0001 standing for the other entity that will shoot at you). By doing this all you need to do to change sides is to kill 1 or 2 ships from the other entity to change your side.

## How to gain standings with Triglavians for the first time

1. Use an empty clone. If you die the NPCs will destroy your pod.
2. Buy a SoE fit destroyer that matches the region you are in. This matters since the Edencom NPC you shoot always spawn according to the empire region you are in and when you pick the right ship you can kill the frigate in a destroyer. For example if you are in Amarr space pick up the Amarr destroyer. Open your fitting window and select community fittings to find the fittings
3. Locate a system that has a Minor Victory status. A good site to see these is here - https://kybernaut.space
4. Open your probe scanner window and look for a EDENCOM Forward Post. These are the easiest sites that spawn in the system.

5. Warp to the site and approach the frigate class ship. They will not shoot at you as you should be neutral to them currently
6. Set your orbit around the frigate and kill it. You must kill the frigate or otherwise the standings wont take effect. As long as you have done damage on the ship you will gain standings from the kill so you can also do the sites in a group.

7. After you have killed the frigate warp out. You only need to kill one single ship. If possible warp to a upwell structure and tether up to avoid roaming NPCs
8. You will now need to wait 20 minutes for the ratting tick. Once this tick happens you will receive a notification that your standing with EDENCOM has decreased and increased with Triglavians.
9. Warp to a triglavian site from your probe scanner to make sure you are now neutral to them and they are not shooting at you.
10. You can now travel thorough Triglavian minor victory systems without getting killed at the gates.

## Changing sides
To change sides repeat the steps above for the forces you want to change for. Depending on your current standing you may need to kill more than one ship.

If you have a lot of standings to grind then it may be a better idea to join proper fleets for either EDENCOM or Triglavians.
