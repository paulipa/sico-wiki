This guide is predominantly aimed at newer players with its basic T1 fitted ships, however I have also included advanced level 4 fits for more skilled players.

I have a recorded class on PVE Fitting Theory which all the below fits are based on. If you would like to learn the theory behind these fits as well as learning how to improve your own, head to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ick5f4RCOk.

## Important Information

Although I have kept all of the modules on the basic fits to T1, the reality is you will not be able to solo level 3 and 4 missions with just full T1 fitted ships and little in the way of skill training.

It is important to make sure that you train good skills alongside your ship and modules - upgrading to t2 modules when you can.  For a good tailored skillplan to follow for your ships, you can click on any of the ships. I will take the Drake as an example.  Head to the 'Mastery' tab and you can follow the levels.

One important thing to note about the mastery tabs is they can occasionally have skills you wouldn't use or train, so use common sense when following them.  E.g: the Drake under medium missiles has both Heavy Missiles and Heavy Assault Missiles in it... but if you are only going to use Heavy Missiles then obviously don't train Heavy Assault Missiles.
