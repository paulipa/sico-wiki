These are basic t1 ship fittings I recommend you use in your missions.  It's not to say these are the only way to fit these ships, but they are certainly one good way of doing so.

I have made fits for all factions excluding minmatar as the t1 basic minmatar ships are simply not good for most PVE applications due to their choice of weaponry (some exceptions can be made, but this is a general rule of thumb).

It is important to make sure that you train good skills alongside your ship and modules - upgrading to t2 modules when you can.  For a good tailored skillplan to follow for your ships, you can show info on any of the ships., I will take the Drake as an example.  Head to the 'Mastery' tab and you can follow the levels.

One important thing to note about the mastery tabs is they can occasionally have skills you wouldn't use or train, so use common sense when following them.  E.g: the Drake under medium missiles has both Heavy Missiles and Heavy Assault Missiles in it... but if you are only going to use Heavy Missiles then obviously don't train Heavy Assault Missiles.
