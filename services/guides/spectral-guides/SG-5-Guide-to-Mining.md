Mining in Eve can be a more dangerous task than some may realise. More often than not, the people who die in mining ships die to players in highsec due to suicide ganking.

Suicide ganking is accomplished in ships such as this

where the goal is to deal as much damage as possible in a short amount of time before CONCORD arrives to kill the ganker (hence suicide ganker).

It is therefore important to both stay vigilant whilst mining and also fly a properly fitted mining ship.

Here's how I recommend you fit your mining ships to make yourself more defensible against suicide ganking.  This also acts as a list of progression as I recommend you skill from the Ventue to the Skiff in this order.

You may notice I have completely excluded the Retriever and Covetor as well as their exhumer variants from the above list.  This is because these ships are extremely fragile and easily killed by just one suicide ganker (two at absolute max).

It is highly advisable to exclusively fly the Procurer and Skiff when in highsec.

Now that we have our mining ships properly fitted, next comes the question of what is the most profitable way to mine.  The most common question a new miner asks is "Should I refine my ore then sell it, or sell the raw ore".

The answer is almost always raw ore - as a new player, your Reprocessing, Reprocessing Efficiency and specialised reprocessing skill such as Pyroxeres Processing will not be very high at all, so you will lose isk in the refining process due to inefficiency.

The most profitable ore to mine for raw profit changes every so often, however you can head to this website https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/ and sort the list by "Isk/M3" to find the highest value ore at your time.

Overall, as of 25/06/2020 the most profitable ore to mine in the game is Mercoxit, however this is an ore found in dangerous nullsec and wormhole space.

The most profitable highsec ore to mine in the game at the moment is Plagioclase at 335.46 Isk/M3.

Every standard ore has two variations associated with it.  Taking Plagioclase as my example, the other two variations are Azure Plagioclase and Rich Plagioclase.

If you click one one of the variants and had to the "Description" tab, at the top it will say it has 5% or 10% improved mineral yield (for Azure and Rich respectively).

Therefore whenever possible, you should try to mine Rich Plagioclase as that is the most profitable variant of that ore, followed by Azure and then the standard Plagioclase.

It should be noted that there are technically three variants to each ore, for Plagioclase the third is Sparkling Plagioclase, however this ore may only be found in moon mining extractions and will not be found in standard highsec asteroid belts.

Here's a useful website to visualise all the ores and see where they are found and what their variants are https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore.
