The Member Qualification Program (MQP) is an introductory PvP training fleet which FC's in SiCo run from time to time.  The fleet lasts around two hours, the first hour being the tutorial part of the fleet and the second being the pvp roam part of the fleet.

I actively encourage all members of SPRAL (and SiCo for that matter) to participate on at least one MQP.  After you've done the training part a few times, you can just skip it and join in on the pvp part.

You will need to be able to fly one of the ships found at https://wiki.silentcoalition.com/en/community/doctrines under "MQP Fleet".  For first-timers I don't recommend you fly one of the Logi ships (healers), but instead one of the four DPS ships.

If you happen to die during your time in an MQP Fleet, your ship will be subject to full SRP (Ship Replacement Program) which means the isk value of your ship will be sent back to you.  You're essentially PvPing for free which is always good in Eve.

You're going to want to be setup on https://auth.silentcoalition.com/dashboard/ to be able to view the Op Timer, access SiCo Discord and request SRP (Link given to you in the fleet).

It's also highly recommended you read and follow SG-1 - Overview/GUI Setup before you join the fleet, as well as train Infomorph Psychology to level 1.

If you need any help with the above, and/or want to see a preview of what an MQP will consist of, you can head to https://www.silentcoalition.com/help-center/member-qualification-program/.

Ignore the section on activating mumble - we currently exclusively use discord in SiCo.
