In Eve, the default overview and GUI you start with is simply put - insufficient.  It lacks in many important areas which are used in every career in the game from pvp to mining.

I have made a youtube video on one way to properly setup your overview and GUI which may be found here.

Join in-game channel 'Z-S Overview' if you want to use the overview mentioned in the video.

Alternatively, feel free to mail Haunting Deity in-game if you want a copy of my personal overview.

I also recommend you ask myself or an experienced PVP pilot for their broadcast settings regardless of which overview you use.

I hope you found this guide useful, if you have any further questions please feel free to mail Haunting Deity either in-game or on discord.
