There is a great misconception about what incursions in Eve actually are.  I often hear players referring to them as "end-game PVE" and "not new player friendly".  This is however false and this guide seeks to show how you are able to join incursions even as a new player.

Firstly; what are incursions?  Incursions are a fleet PVE activity, similar to instances or raids in other MMORPG's.  They spawn randomly across New Eden - the lore is that the Sansha Nation (an NPC faction) are invading systems, and capsuleers have to go and fight off the invasion to save the system.

It is vital to note; it is not possible to solo an incursion, do not attempt to do so as you will simply die.

With basic incursions such as the Vanguards run by our alliance incursion group or a popular newbro friendly group such as Warp To Me (WTM), you can make around 100-150 million isk per hour.

Once you have learned the ropes and gotten good skills, you can consider a more advanced group such as The Ditanian Fleet (TDF) which can make between 240-300 million isk per hour, but these are not new player friendly and I don't recommend it to anyone who is brand new to the game or incursions.

To run with SiCo Incursions, head to https://auth.silentcoalition.com/groups/ and join the "Special Interest: Incursions" group.

Once you join that, you will now have the Incursions channel on your discord where the fleets are formed for and you can ask further questions in there.

You will need to train for and purchase one of the ships from the incursion doctrine found here https://wiki.silentcoalition.com/en/community/doctrines under "Incursions Vanguards".

The praxis is the cheapest ship to purchase - it will cost around 250 million which you will earn back in 2.5 hours of incursions.

From there you want to try and get yourself a Nightmare, train t2 guns and you will be able to work out what to do from there.

I also recommend reading the WTM newbro guide to incursions found here https://forums.warptome.net/rookie-guide, you can skip the first few sections and read onwards from "Settings" (this section and downwards https://i.imgur.com/v4cWY6X.png).

On top of that you should setup your overview and GUI properly, a guide to this is found in SG-1.

SiCo don't run all the time though, when they aren't running, you can join this almost 24/7 public community by joining in-game channel "Warp To Me Incursions",

You won't be able to use a SiCo incursion ship for this community though, you will need a ship from their doctrine instead found at https://wl.warptome.net/fits/.

You can also ask them questions in their channel (linked above), and/or read their newbro guide also linked above.
