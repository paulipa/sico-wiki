Now that you have gotten settled with a nice overview and GUI (found in SG-1), its time to start making some ISK.

One of the best ways for a new player to make ISK in this game is via exploration - the scanning of relic and data sites to hack for loot.

Unfortunately, the most profitable of said sites are found within the most dangerous parts of space (naturally).

I have therefore made a short video series on how to properly fit your exploration ships, scan signatures efficiently and how to keep safe within a wormhole as you go around looking for data and relic sites to loot.

Always remember: spam your D-Scan constantly, if you see any probes (core or combat) then immediently warp out to your safe spot (discussed in the video).

Always remember: keep a watchful eye not only on your D-Scan but on your overview as well, some people already have the sites scanned out and wait for you to go there.

Exploration is very much feast or famine... entierly based on luck.  One day you can make 100 million isk, and then make nothing the next.
