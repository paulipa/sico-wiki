Hello there, if you are reading this it is very likely you have recently joined the alliance and are ready to move yourself and your assets over to our headquarters.

Eve is a dangerous game however... everything must be moved manually and this can open you up to attack as you move your assets system to system.

You see, in eve it is possible to be killed by players even in high security space by means of 'Suicide Ganking' where players will fit ships specifically designed to deal a large amount of damage in a short amount of time in order to kill you before CONCORD (space police) arrive to take them out.

---
If you have recently completed your career agent missions (Security, Business etc) you will have been given a basic hauling ship upon completion of the Industry career agent, however without certain modifications to your hauler it is likely you won't be able to move all of the ships and equipment gained from the career agent missions.

For this reason I highly encourage you to use a properly fitted hauling ship.

If you find you don't need all of the cargohold space, you can swap out some of the Expanded Cargohold I's for Inertial Stabilizer I's to enter warp faster.

You will also then be able to fly over to Amarr VIII (Oris) - Emperor Family Academy which is the closest tradehub to our headquarters.

Purchase what you need from there and then haul your items over to Ronne - SiCO Trade Center where you will have then successfully moved to our alliance HQ.

I strongly discourage anyone to haul more than 50,000,000 (50 million) ISK in value in these t1 haulers.  Even around that point, the risk of being suicide ganked is reasonably high.  Going beyond this number increases the risk further and further as gankers are more inclined to shoot higher value haulers.

---
It is also worth noting that there are other t1 haulers which are capable of hauling larger amounts of goods, the Iteron Mark V, Tayra, Mammoth and Bestower for Gallente, Caldari, Minmatar and Amarr respectively.

I don't recommend using these ships however unless you are carrying items which are high volume/low value such as ore and minerals.  This is because these ships are significantly weaker and have lower ehp (effective hitpoints) and are therefore more easily ganked.

There are also specialised haulers which are designed to move specific items.  The Hoarder is specifically focused on hauling ammo.  The Miasmos for ore, Kryos for minerals and the Epithal for PI (Planetary Interaction) items.
