Hello!  If you are reading this, it is very likely you have recently joined the corp and are ready to move yourself and your assets over to our HQ at  Ronne - LinkNet Trade Center.

Eve is a dangerous game however - everything must be moved manually and this can make you vulnerable to attack during your journey system to system.

## Understanding Suicide Ganking

You see, in Eve it is possible to be killed by players even in high security space by means of "Suicide Ganking".  This is where players will fit ships with the sole purpose of dealing as large amount of damage as possible in a short amount of time before CONCORD (space police) arrive to take them out.

Once a player attacks you in highsec, CONCORD will arrive to kill them assuming you don't have a suspect or criminal timer.  Information on how these timers are gained found at https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Aggression_101#Security_flags.

Depending on the security of the system you are in, CONCORD will take increasingly longer to respond as the security decreases.  You can see the security status of the system you are in by looking at the top left of your screen and seeing the number next to it.  You can see from https://i.imgur.com/6tpYZQT.png that Ronne for example has a security status of 0.7.

CONCORD Response Times
1.0 - 6 Seconds
0.9 - 6 Seconds
0.8 - 7 Seconds
0.7 - 10 Seconds
0.6 - 14 Seconds
0.5 - 19 Seconds
0.4 - -1.0 - Lowsec/Nullsec, No CONCORD Response 

From this we can understand that the lower the security status of the system you are in - the more dangerous it is even if it is highsec.  

Imagine a ship which does 600 dps (damage per second).  In a 1.0 system for example, it will be able to deal 3,600 total damage (6 seconds x 600dps = 3,600 damage) before CONCORD comes to wipe them out.  In a 0.6 system however, it will be able to deal 8,400 damage.

It is therefore important to exercise vigilance and caution in the space you are flying through during your hauling.  If you take a look at this route https://i.imgur.com/hDVt9TB.png for example, I have highlighted the 0.5 security systems where CONCORD will only respond 19 seconds later.

## Preventing Suicide Ganking

If you completed the Business career agent missions (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Business_Career_Agent), at the end you would have been given a t1 hauling ship.  These ships are the tankier, higher-hp versions of the hauling ships and I highly recommend you use them in your hauling journey as a new player.

These fits are designed to be as tanky as possible given the contraints of low skillpoints and cost.

A general rule of thumb is 1 EHP = 3,000 ISK.  What EHP means in Eve as well as how to find it goes beyond the scope of this guide, however I can tell you that a completely brand new character can expect to find the following EHP with each fit;

EHP and Max Isk Loads
Nereus - 17,500 EHP - 52,500,000 ISK
Badger - 19,800 EHP - 59,400,000 ISK
Sigil - 18,800 EHP - 56,400,000 ISK
Wreath - 17,600 EHP - 52,800,000 ISK

The above values are with the recommended fits, if you don't fit them properly then you will have less ehp and should carry less ISK.

It's worthwhile noting that the more ISK you carry in your ships, the more inclined suicide gankers are to kill you as they are after your loot.  Furthermore the lower the security of the system you fly through, the higher the chance of being suicide ganked due to it being easier to do so (for reasons explained above).

Try whenever possible to stay in as high security status as possible and restrict your loads to approx 50,000,000 ISK

## Understanding Triglavian Invasions

Another game mechanic you should be aware of, not just for hauling, but in general are triglavian invasions.  If we look now at this route https://i.imgur.com/8KCpaRB.png, I have highlighted two systems which have a triangle symbol to mark their system.

This symbol means these systems are under triglavian invasion.  The one in red is Niarja, a system to be absolutely avoided in anything other than a shuttle or extremely fast travel ship.  This system is effectively nullsec and players can shoot you in it without any intervention from CONCORD.  It also happens to be an important chokepoint for travel between Amarr/Minmatar and Caldari/Gallente space.

If you are living in Amarr/Minmatar space, as long as you don't intend to travel over those other two factions then Niarja won't be an issue for you.  If you are living in Caldari/Gallente space, moving your assets to Ronne is going to be problematic for you.

You can right-click Niarja on your route and click "Avoid Niarja (Solar System)".  

With this setup - between Dodixie (Gallente Trade Hub) and Ronne, the route is now 30 jumps.
                 between Jita (Caldari Trade Hub) and Ronne, the route is now 41 jumps.

The route is however laced with trig invaded systems (although not as affected to the same extent as Niarja is... they are still highsec and CONCORD will be present).
