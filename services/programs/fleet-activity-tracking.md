# Fleet Activity Tracking
**The coalition measures player activity and their participation in fleet activity** with a FAT system (Fleet activity tracking). These points are purely there to provide data for our leadership both for the amount of raised fleets by fleet commanders and the activity in the fleet. **They are and will never be used to punish people that do not participate in fleets.**

## How do I get FATs?
You will be able to get FATs by joining any coalition fleets, may it be mining, pve or pvp. Any fleet that undocks from a station and is raised by a coalition commander will be entitled for giving our FAT links.

> Only PVE and PVP fleets are tracked. Mining fleets do not provide any FATS.

## To register your FAT point:
1. Make sure you have registered yourself on https://auth.silentcoalition.com as the FAT system is integrated in AUTH. If you are flying with an alt make sure the alt is also added under your main characters AUTH.
1. Be in the fleet that has an official fleet commander
1. Fleet members are tracked by the FC. When the FC tells you that the fleet has been tracker/fatted it means your FAT has been registered.
1. You can monitor your participation on the AUTH fleet tracking section https://auth.silentcoalition.com/fat/

## Why do I need FATs?
You donâ€™t need FAT points as we do not require any minimum activity from our members. However you can get rewards and fame for high activity and also provide important data for the coalition so that we can improve our services and activity.

## How many FATs do i have?
You can track your own participation in fleets via AUTH.
