# Member Qualification Program
The Member Qualification Program (MQP) is a program that will push you thorough all of our core services and teach you the basics of flying together with your fellow pilots. It is designed to be easy to follow and complete even with minimal or none understanding of the various fleet mechanisms in the game.

**After completing the course you will be rewarded a member title if you are in SEADC** and you will gain access to the in-game assets restricted behind this role.

**The MQP is a three step program** that includes a systems checklist for setting up all of your systems (once before your first ever fleet), pre-fleet section (before every fleet you join) that will make sure you are set and ready for the training fleet and the actuall training fleet, in which you will be taken either into PvE or PvP action in a fleet enviroment and get to use the skills that you have red about in the pre-fleet section.

Please follow each step mentioned in this guide to make sure you are ready for the training fleet and have activated all of the required services.

> MQP fleets are not limited to new players! You are allowed to join them again later on at any time whenever a fleet goes live.

# Systems Checklist
It is highly recommended that you have everything set up for fleet operations before you attend the MQP fleets. This is to allow us to spend more time on the fleet itself rather than setting up each members that are not set up.

You only need to do the systems checklist once before you join your first ever fleet. The systems will be all set after that for any future operations unless you change your PC and lose settings such as overview settings.

## 1. Join SC Comms ingame channel
All of our fleets will be linked in the coalition general channel. While you should had done this right away when you joined the coalition now you can still fix the mistake if you havent. You can read more about the communication channel in here [Ingame Channels](/tools/communication/ingame-channels)

## 2. Register on AUTH
If for some reason you have not yet registered on AUTH now is the time to do it. Please follow the guide in here for AUTH registration as you will need it in the next steps: [AUTH guide](/tools/auth)

## 3. Apply for groups
The coalition has different groups that represent people with roles. You can apply to any of the groups in here https://auth.silentcoalition.com/groups/. 

### Normal group
Normal groups are groups for people that want to take up special roles in the coalition. These roles most often requires some skills or higher understanding about the game and each applicant will be approached individually via discord before their application is accepted.

### Special Interest Groups
Special Interest Groups are open groups that anyone can join or leave at any time. These groups are there to help you out to find the players that are interested in the same things that you are interested in. These activities vary from mining to pvp.

> Make sure that you apply to the special interest group for MQP as that is where fleet pings for MQP will be sent!
{.is-warning}

### Special Interest Group: MQP
Special Interest Group: MQP is yet again a special interest group designed for people who like to know when the MQP fleets go live. This channel will be globally pinged whenever a MQP fleet goes live so it is important that you apply for it. You are able to leave it later on if you have no further interest in MQP fleets after your first run.

## 4. Activate Discord and Mumble
Voice comms are a must for all fleet operations. It is important that you are able to join the communication channels used for each fleet. Most often we will be using Discord voice channels for fleet ops but in some cases Mumble might be preferred.

[Guide for setting up Discord](/tools/communication/discord)
[Guide for setting up Mumble](/tools/communication/mumble)

> It is important that you can access the fleet channels on mumble and on discord before the fleet starts! There might be no time to fix your access when the fleet goes up.
{.is-danger}

## 5. Overview Setup
It is important to have a good overview setup. We highly recommend that you use our overview guide and the Z-S Overview pack as your overview base. The guide for the setup is found in here: [Overview guide](/services/guides/overview)

## 6. Train for ships | Doctrines
When we are talking about doctrinse in EVE online we are talking about ships, fits and their relations in fleet operations. Doctrines are pre-doctrined setups that are to be used in different engagements.

**It is very important that all players inside the corporation would be able to or would be training to fly our core doctrine ships.** Reason for doctrines is that depending on the enemy, situation and purpose of the engagement the ships used may differ by a lot. If people are flying wrong type of ships compared to the majority of the fleet they are ineffective or may even harm the fleet.

The corporation and coalition has created a few basic doctrine ships that you should aim for. These ships have been designed based on our fleet numbers and pilot capabilities. All of our doctrines are visible in here https://wiki.silentcoalition.com/en/community/doctrines

### MQP Doctrine
MQP fleets have a standard doctrine that will help you getting started with the training for the larger doctrine hulls. There are two different types of MQP doctrines: Newbro MQP fits and Advanced MQP fits.

Newbro MQP fits are meant for brand new players who have low skill points. These basic ships are super fast to train for and will allow you to join any MQP fleet. They include both low value DPS ships and logistic ships for you to choose from.

> MQP doctrines are located at https://wiki.silentcoalition.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#mqp-fleet
{.is-info}

### Coalition Primary Combat Doctrines
Our most important doctrine group is called Ferox Fleet. These ships will be used for all serious operations where it is important to have a correct and functioning combination of ships.

This doctrine contains different types of ships with the following importance order from the most important ships to the least important. You should aim to train up towards the most important ships with your best capabilities:

`Logistics > DPS > Tackle > Support`

#### Logistic ships
The logistic ships are always in high demand in all fleet types. They are the ships that keeps the other ships alive (aka. healers). Since logistic ships do not provide any benefits for solo playing they are most often not the first choice for new players to train for. However the amount of logistics is what often determines if a fleet stays alive or dies. Great thing about logistic ships are that they work out with several different doctrine setups (shield logistics for shield tanked fleets and armor ones for armor tanked fleets)

#### DPS Ships
DPS ships are the main punching force of the fleet. It provides the killing force and without DPS there is no point to engage in a fight. Problem with DPS doctrines are that there are a vast variety of different DPS doctrines depending on the fleet composition. With a community that has a lot of different doctrines it also mean that you need to train for a lot of fits.

#### Tackle ships
Tackle ships are also in key role in fleet engagements. Most often the amount of kills a fleet can get depends on the amount of enemies they are able to tackle and hold still. As the main DPS ships are slow and bulky they are unable to hold down the enemy ships. This is where tackle comes in. A good tackler in the right place can make all the difference in the killboard.

#### Support Ships
Support ships are designed for players with low skill points. While they do not provide much DPS or logistics or tackling power to the field they support and boost the effects of the main doctrine ships. They are most often fitted with electronic warfare modules such as target painters that will increase enemy signature radios making the whole rest of the fleet hit them harder.

## 7. Buying & Fitting doctrine ships
Once you know what doctrine ships are used in the coalition fleets the next task is to buy and fit the ships. There are several methods for buying your ships, some more efficient than others.

### Doctrine Contracts
Players in the coalition will be trying to keep the most important doctrines up on corporation contracts. However since the contracts are limited to corporation you are unable to access contracts made by other corporations and for this reason the doctrine you are looking for might not be available for you.

> For logistical reasons the doctrine contracts may have the rigs inside the cargo hold instead of fitted on the ship. Make sure you fit the rigs before you depart!
{.is-warning}

To check out if a specific doctrine can be found from your corporation contracts simply open the contract window and fill in the proper filters.
![doctrine-contract-1085x800.jpg](/doctrine-contract-1085x800.jpg =300x)

### Buying from market
If there are no doctrine contracts up for you then the next thing you can do is to go to a trade hub and buy the doctrine fitting in there. Keep in mind that the further the hub is from Jita (the main hub) the more likely the prices are to be inflated.

You may not even find all of the items from the market you are looking at! If you are far out from markets then it is important that you have bought your fit and ship before the fleet starts!

### Fitting doctrine ships
You are allowed to change the meta version of the module (T1, T2 or meta 1-4) of any doctrine if you are unable to fly the fit with the T2 modules. 

> You are not allowed to change the module type of the doctrines!
{.is-danger}

For example changing a micro warp drive to an afterburner because you do not have high enough fittings skills to fit the micro MWD. If you change the module types you change how the ship behave in combat situations and either hurt your own or the whole fleets performance.

> Changing meta version of the module may effect your ship total price. Be aware that if the total price is greatly increased you may not receive full SRP payouts for modified fits.

# Pre-Fleet Checklist
If you have completed all of the steps in the systems checkup you should be ready to start to get ready for the training fleet! **Getting prepared for MQP feets is similar to preparing for any fleets that are scheduled to happen!**

Pre-fleet checklist steps are general steps that you should do before each fleet you join.

## 1. When, where and how
Each scheduled fleet will be posted on our fleet operations section on AUTH. The easiest way to know about upcoming fleets is to do a discord command. You can also check up on all upcoming and past coalition fleets in the auth section located in here https://auth.silentcoalition.com/optimer/
![mqpfleet-600x397.jpg](/mqpfleet-600x397.jpg =300x)

`!ops` command done in any of the authenticated discord channels (so not in the public one) will provide you the same list of upcoming operations that you can see  via AUTH. However it is much more convenient to use the command on discord than go to the page each time. To find out when the next MQP fleet is happening simply check for any scheduled MQP Fleets.

## 2. Have the right doctrine
Each fleet has a doctrine that it will be using. Make sure you have the right doctrine for the right fleet. In this case you should be using the `MQP doctrine`.

## 3. Move in time
If you do not have your MQP ship located in the starting location for the fleet make sure that you move in there before the fleet starts. When the fleet starts it won’t be waiting for people to start moving over to the location.

## 4. Expect to die, do not have expensive implants
Like in most activities in EVE death is always lurking behind the corner. Be prepared to lose everything you bring with you, including your POD. To save your implants you should switch to an empty clone. It is also a good idea to have your death clone set at the staging system so that you can easily reship if you die. You can read more about jump and medical clones in here: [Guides: Clones](/services/guides/clones)

# MQP Fleet
It is finally time to actually get to play the game itself! When a MQP fleet is up this is how it is all going to go down. The actual fleet may and most likely will differ from the fleet structure descried in this section and it is more used as a guide for the fleet commanders so that they do not miss anything.

## 1. Join the fleet
**Whenever a flete is going up you will receive a ping on our discord.** Check the ping for the fleet details and find the fleet in the fleet finder or by clicking on the link that should be posted on the SC Comms in-game channel.
![fleet-search.jpg](/fleet-search.jpg =300x)

## 2. Check the MOTD
The fleet MOTD is similar to normal MOTDs and will be located on top of the fleet chat window. You can reload the MOTD from the settings button of the fleet window. The MOTD will and may contain information about your current fleet.

See the gif for reloading MOTD: [Reloading MOTD](/reload-motd_(1).mp4)

## 3. Join the voice comms
Now that you are in a fleet all of the commands and information will be give over voice comms. Check the MOTD of the fleet channel to see if a specific channel is described and if not seek for Discord voice channel with members in it.

> Always pay close attention to the commands on the voice comms and let the FC know if you need to AFK.
{.is-info}

# During the Fleet
From this point on you are in the hands of your fleet commander. During the MQP fleets the commander will take you thorough the following things mentioned in the FC’s Checklist for MQP Fleets in here: [FC Checlist for MQP fleets](/services/flightmanuals/fc-mqp-checklist)

# After the fleet, finishing your training
After the MQP fleet is over you are qualified for your member title. The member title will be given for all players who have attended the MQP fleets and who have registered their participation in the fleet by using the FAT system.

If you attended a PvP fleet and had losses in the fleet then you also may want to apply for SRP. You can read more about SRP in here: [Ship replacement program](/services/programs/ship-replacement-program)

> If you want the membet title given on your alt please mail your alt names to your corporation CEO as we won’t check your alts when we give out the member title for the character that has taken part in the MQP fleet.
