# Member Qualification Program
The Member Qualification Program (MQP) is a program that will push you thorough all of our core services and teach you the basics of flying together with your fellow pilots. It is designed to be easy to follow and complete even with minimal or no understanding of the various fleet mechanisms in the game.

**The MQP is a three step program** that includes a systems checklist for setting up all of your systems (once before your first ever fleet), pre-fleet section (before every fleet you join) that will make sure you are set and ready for the training fleet and the actual training fleet, in which you will be taken either into PvE or PvP action in a fleet enviromment and get to use the skills that you have read about in the pre-fleet section.

Please follow each step mentioned in this guide to make sure you are ready for the training fleet and have activated all of the required services.

> MQP fleets are not limited to new players! You are allowed to join them again later or at any time whenever a fleet goes live.

# Systems Checklist
It is highly recommended that you have everything set up for fleet operations before you attend the MQP fleets. This is to allow us to spend more time on the fleet itself rather than setting up each member that is not set up.

You only need to do the systems checklist once before you join your first ever fleet. The systems will be all set after that for any future operations unless you change your PC and lose settings such as overview settings.

## 1. Join LinkNet General ingame channel
All of our fleets will be linked in the community general channel. While you should had done this rightaway when you joined the community, you can still fix the mistake now if you haven't done so yet. You can read more about the communication channels in here [Ingame Channels](/tools/communication/ingame-channels)

## 2. Register on AUTH
If for some reason you have not yet registered on AUTH now is the time to do it. Please follow the guide in here for AUTH registration as you will need it in the next steps: [AUTH guide](/tools/auth)

## 3. Apply for groups
The coalition has different groups that represent people with roles. You can apply to any of the groups in here https://auth.eve-linknet.com/groups/. 

### Role group
Role groups are groups for people that want to take up special roles in the community. These roles most often requires some skills or higher understanding about the game and each applicant will be approached individually via discord before their application is accepted.

### Special Interest Groups
Special Interest Groups are open groups that anyone can join or leave at any time. These groups are there to help you out to find the players that are interested in the same things that you are interested in. These activities vary from mining to pvp.

> Make sure that you apply to the special interest group for MQP as that is where fleet pings for MQP will be sent!
{.is-warning}

### Special Interest Group: MQP
Special Interest Group: MQP is yet again a special interest group designed for people who like to know when the MQP fleets go live. This group will be globally pinged whenever a MQP fleet goes live so it is important that you apply for it. You are able to leave it later on if you have no further interest in MQP fleets after your first run.

## 4. Activate Discord and Mumble
Voice comms are a must for all fleet operations. It is important that you are able to join the communication channels used for each fleet. Most often we will be using Discord voice channels for fleet ops but in some cases Mumble might be preferred.

[Guide for setting up Discord](/tools/communication/discord) <- Primary
[Guide for setting up Mumble](/tools/communication/mumble) <- Backup (optional)

> It is important that you can access the fleet channels on mumble and on discord before the fleet starts! There might be no time to fix your access when the fleet goes up.
{.is-danger}

## 5. Overview Setup
It is important to have a good overview setup. We highly recommend that you use our overview guide and the Z-S Overview pack as your overview base. The guide for the setup is found in here: [Overview guide](/services/guides/overview)

## 6. Train for ships | Doctrines
When we are talking about doctrinse in EVE online we are talking about ships, fits and their relations in fleet operations. Doctrines are pre-doctrined setups that are to be used in different engagements.

**It is very important that all players inside the corporation would be able to or would be training to fly our core doctrine ships.** Reason for doctrines is that depending on the enemy, situation and purpose of the engagement the ships used may differ by a lot. If people are flying wrong type of ships compared to the majority of the fleet they are ineffective or may even harm the fleet.

The community has created a few basic doctrine ships that you should aim for. These ships have been designed based on our fleet numbers and pilot capabilities. All of our doctrines are visible in here https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/doctrines

### MQP Doctrine
MQP fleets use a standard doctrine that will help you getting started with the training for the larger doctrine hulls.

Newbro MQP fits are meant for brand new players who have low skill points. These basic ships are super fast to train for and will allow you to join any MQP fleet. They include both low value DPS ships and logistic ships for you to choose from.

> MQP doctrines are located at https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#mqp-fleet
{.is-info}

### Community Primary Combat Doctrines
Our most important doctrine group is called Ferox Fleet. These ships will be used for all serious operations where it is important to have a correct and functioning combination of ships.

This doctrine contains different types of ships with the following importance order from the most important ships to the least important. You should aim to train up towards the most important ships with your best capabilities:

`Logistics > DPS > Tackle > Support`

#### Logistic ships
The logistic ships are always in high demand in all fleet types. They are the ships that keeps the other ships alive (aka. healers). Since logistic ships do not provide any benefits for solo playing they are most often not the first choice for new players to train for. However the amount of logistics is what often determines if a fleet stays alive or dies. Great thing about logistic ships are that they work out with several different doctrine setups (shield logistics for shield tanked fleets and armor ones for armor tanked fleets)

#### DPS Ships
DPS ships are the main punching force of the fleet. They provides the killing force and without DPS there is no point to engage in a fight. Problem with DPS doctrines are that there are a vast variety of different DPS doctrines depending on the fleet composition. With a community that has a lot of different doctrines it also mean that you need to train for a lot of fits.

#### Tackle ships
Tackle ships are also in key role in fleet engagements. Most often the amount of kills a fleet can get depends on the amount of enemies they are able to tackle and hold still. As the main DPS ships are slow and bulky they are unable to hold down the enemy ships. This is where tackle comes in. A good tackler in the right place can make all the difference in the killboard.

#### Support Ships
Support ships are designed for players with low skill points. While they do not provide much DPS or logistics or tackling power to the field they support and boost the effects of the main doctrine ships. They are most often fitted with electronic warfare modules such as target painters that will increase enemy signature radius making the whole rest of the fleet hit them harder.

## 7. Buying & Fitting doctrine ships
Once you know what doctrine ships are used in the community fleets the next task is to buy and fit the ships. There are several methods for buying your ships, some more efficient than others.

### Buying from market
The most obvious way of getting your ship and the fitting for it is to buy them from the market. Check out the doctrine page and compare the items to the market orders. The closer of formup system you can buy your doctrine ships the less moving you need to do. However prices at random formup systems might cost more than they would at the trade hubs.

You can check if your local station can supply you with all of the needed modules by copying the whole doctrine fit and pastingit into the multibuy window on the market browser.

In the case of the MQP Doctrine, all of the required parts can be bought at our Coalition tradehub in Ronne, the LinkNet Trade Center. Due to the logistical effort the prices here might be higher than in Jita. The closest large hub to us is Amarr.

### Handout ships
Sometimes ships are handed out in fleets. You can find this information from the event details on our [operation calendar](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/opcalendar/). However MQP ships are not handed out as the goal is to teach you how to buy and fit your own ships.

### Fitting doctrine ships
You are allowed to change the meta version of the module (T1, T2 or meta 1-4) of any doctrine if you are unable to fly the fit with the T2 modules. Open the show info window of each module and go to the variations tab to see the different meta variations.

Chefk gif: [Item Variations](/item_variations.mp4)

> You are not allowed to change the module type of the doctrines!
{.is-danger}

For example changing a micro warp drive to an afterburner because you do not have high enough fittings skills to fit the micro MWD is not allowed. If you change the module types you change how the ship behave in combat situations and either hurt your own or the whole fleets performance.

> Changing meta version of the module may effect your ship total price. Be aware that if the total price is greatly increased you may not receive full SRP payouts for modified fits.
{.is-warning}

# Pre-Fleet Checklist
If you have completed all of the steps in the systems checkup you should be ready to start to get ready for the training fleet! **Getting prepared for MQP feets is similar to preparing for any fleets that are scheduled to happen!**

Pre-fleet checklist steps are general steps that you should do before each fleet you join.

## 1. When, where and how
Each scheduled fleet will be posted on our [operation calendar](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/opcalendar/) on AUTH. In this case you are interested in the MQP fleets. You can find all of our events from the calendar.

When you click on the event you will see more details about it such as: what doctrine to use, where the formup is, what comms the event is using and who the fleet commander is for the fleet. If you have questions about the fleet most often the best way to ask is the fleet commander who hosts the operation.

![mqp_fleet_calendar.png](/mqp_fleet_calendar.png =600x)

You can also use the discord bot with the command `!ops` to get a list of the upcoming operations.

![mqpfleet-600x397.jpg](/mqpfleet-600x397.jpg =300x)

When a fleet is about to go live you will be pinged on our discord. Note that we only ping the relevant groups on normal operations instead of `@everyone`. For this reason it is important that you opt in to the [SIG groups]( https://auth.eve-linknet.com/groups/) for content that interests you. This way you will be mentioned in the fleet pings once the fleets go up.

![ping_groups.png](/ping_groups.png =300x)

## 2. Have the right doctrine
Each fleet has a [doctrine](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/doctrines) that it will be using. Make sure you have the right doctrine for the right fleet. In this case you should be using the [MQP doctrine](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#mqp-fleet).

## 3. Move in time
If you do not have your MQP ship located in the starting location for the fleet make sure that you move in there before the fleet starts. When the fleet starts it won’t be waiting for people to start moving over to the location.

## 4. Expect to die, do not have expensive implants
Like in most activities in EVE death is always lurking behind the corner. Be prepared to lose everything you bring with you, including your POD. To save your implants you should switch to an empty clone. 

It is also a good idea to have your death clone set at the staging system so that you can easily reship if you die. You can read more about jump and medical clones in here: [Guides: Clones](/services/guides/clones)

# MQP Fleet
It is finally time to actually get to play the game itself! When a MQP fleet is up this is how it is all going to go down. The actual fleet may and most likely will differ from the fleet structure described in this section and it is more used as a guide for the fleet commanders so that they do not miss anything.

## 1. Join the fleet
**Whenever a fleet is going up you will receive a ping on our discord.** Check the ping for the fleet details and find the fleet in the fleet finder or by clicking on the link that should be posted on the SC Comms in-game channel.
![fleet-search.jpg](/fleet-search.jpg =300x)

## 2. Check the MOTD
The fleet MOTD is similar to normal MOTDs and will be located on top of the fleet chat window. You can reload the MOTD from the settings button of the fleet window. The MOTD will and may contain information about your current fleet.

See the gif for reloading MOTD: [Reloading MOTD](/reload-motd_(1).mp4)

## 3. Join the voice comms
Now that you are in a fleet all of the commands and information will be given over voice comms. Check the MOTD of the fleet channel to see if a specific channel is described and if not seek for Discord voice channel with members in it.

> Always pay close attention to the commands on the voice comms and let the FC know if you need to AFK.
{.is-info}

# During the Fleet
From this point on you are in the hands of your fleet commander. 

During the MQP fleets the commander will take you through the following things mentioned in the FC’s Checklist for MQP Fleets in here: [FC Checlist for MQP fleets](/services/flightmanuals/fc-mqp-checklist)

If there were losses during the fleet the FC will guide you to apply for [Ship replacement program](/services/programs/ship-replacement-program)

After the fleet your participation will be tracked by the fleet commander by using a FAT system. You can check your own FAT points from auth fleet [activity section](https://auth.eve-linknet.com/imicusfat/).
# After the fleet, whats next
