# Capital Support System
**So you want to have a ship that will be posted on comms as a zkill link when you die?** You have come to the right place! Capital ships used to be rare toys when they first were published. Nowadays every kid and their cat has one, at least if you ask any bitter vets.

**For a new player the road to a capital ship might seem long.** Not only do they cost several billion ISK they take a good while to train for. Luckily thanks to skill injectors and free SP events made by CCP training into a capital ship is now easier than ever.

**But it is not only about being able to fly the ship, its also about knowing how to fly the ship.** Since flying capitals is much different than flying any other ships it is likely that you will end up as a zkill link sooner than later if you do not educate yourself before you undock.

SiCO Capital Support System is here to help you to get into your very own capital ship.

## Joining SiCO capital group
To get started with your capital fun you need to join the `Special Interest Group: Capitals` on AUTH. This will make the capital public channel visible for you on discord where you can seek help for getting set up with your capital.

## Training for the ship
The obvious first thing that you need to fly a capital ship is the skills to fly the hull. It is rather easy to determine what skills you need to fly a capital ship by simply looking at the skill requirements of the hull and training for them.

## Training support skills
Now comes the hard part. Flying a capital ship requires tons and tons of support skills. Support skills are what actually make you to be able to do something in the ship besides exploding up. Each different group in EVE tends to have their own requirements for their ship to make their capital pilots match with their alliances game play. 

Since we are not hardcore players in SiCO we have adapted the way of EVEUNI for capital skill training. This allows us to have different levels of skill plans starting from this ship will blow up as soon as i undock to the elite train it all skill plans.

S**o after you got your hull skills you want to start to train for the level of support skills you feel is the right one for you.** The plans are located on our forums in here: https://forum.silentcoalition.com/viewforum.php?f=48

## Ordering the hull
Once you have decided on what capital you want to go for you need to order the hull for it. To order a hull go to our web store in here and order your hull https://www.silentcoalition.com/product-category/capital-ships-2/

Hulls are built for you without any profit which means these hulls are to be used and blown up, not to be sold further to someone else with profit.

## Getting in official capital group
To get in the verified capital groups for people that actually have the skills and hulls you need to:
- Have a fitted capital ship
- Have the skills to fly it

Once you have those send me (Ikarus Cesaille) an image of your capital ship fitting as well as an image of the ship in your hangar so that i can know that you have your setup up and will add you manually into the capital groups!
