Loud Crew [LOUCR] is a special interest department for the SiCO members. It is designed to protect our high sec sovereignty against entities that are not war eligible. To do this the members of this corporations are committing themselves in criminal activities.

> As criminal actions in High Sec Space ruin your security standing the characters in LOCRE are recommended to be alts that have been created purely for this purpose.

A lot what we use in LOUCR is already used in CODE. We highly recommend that you read the following guides for ganking at their page: http://www.minerbumping.com/p/blog-page.html

# Guide for creating LOUCR alt
The process of creating an alt for LOUCR is very similar to the SLTRN war corporation alt with the exception that LOUCR alts mainly need to fly one ship where SLTRN alts needs to have a wider variety of skills.

## Creating the account
The following steps will get you into your very own 500 dps ganking catalyst, made famous by CODE.


1. Use a buddy invite of your own by making on in here https://www.eveonline.com/recruit or alternatively you can use the buddy invite created by us: https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=dbb7443d-c7b0-4133-92ce-58d6165c71bd
1. Create a new account and activate it.
1. Next you want to create a gallente character.
1. Make an ingame application to the Loud Crew [LOUCR] corporation
1. Join to the Special Interest: Ganking & Piracy on AUTH or click the following link to join the group https://auth.silentcoalition.com/group/request_add/89

## Injecting Skills
Now we will use the skill point pack that you got from the buddy invite to inject you directly into the ship. You need to do 0 seconds of your own training.

1. The first thing that you need to do is to obviously to redeem the free skill points. Open your redeem item windows and redeem the civilian skill point pack! You now have 1 000 000 free skill points that you can inject. 
1. Next you need to buy skills, add them in your skill que and inject SP. Since you can only add 24 hours worth of skills you will need to do this step by step. So go ahead and open your character sheet and go to the skills section. Buy, add to que and inject SP to get the following skills (CODE Catalyst Skill Plan):

- Surgical Strike II (adds 3% DPS)
- Cybernetics II (allows you to use the SS-903 implant that adds 3% DPS)
- Rapid Firing III (4% DPS)
- Surgical Strike III (3% DPS)
- Small Hybrid Turret IV (5% DPS)
- Small Hybrid Turret V (5% DPS)
- Motion Predication III (Prerequisite for the next skill)
- Small Blaster Specialization I (Unlocks t2 guns; 2% DPS for T2 guns)
- Small Blaster Specialization II (2% DPS for T2 guns)
- Small Blaster Specialization III (2% DPS for T2 guns)
- Rapid Firing IV (4% DPS) â€“ Weapon Upgrades III (Gives you much needed CPU)
- Weapon Upgrades IV (extra CPU; unlocks T2 Magnetic Field Stabilizers)
- Surgical strike IV (3% DPS)
- Jury Rigging I (Prerequisite for Hybrid weapon rigging)
- Jury Rigging II
- Jury Rigging III
- Hybrid Weapon Rigging I (Gives you some much needed PG)
- CPU Management V (extra CPU, allows use of all mid-slot modules)
- Thermodynamics I or higher (allows you to overheat)

3. You are now able to fly the T2 fitted catalyst that reaches over 500 DPS

## Life in LOUCR
LOUCR characters are really good only for one thing, which is ganking. We will be mainly focusing on ganking entities that are using our services in high sec space without committing to the coalition. So this is mainly neutral miners in our moon belts.

You will be able to pick up ships from the corporation HQ hangar in our HQ system (Audaerne) and gank any player who is not blue to you. The primary goal is to maintain order in our high sec operating systems.
