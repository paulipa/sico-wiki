# Ship Replacement Program
EVE is all about blowing up other players and getting blown up. It is something that you canâ€™t avoid even if you would try to stay away from PvP as much as possible. As a new player still learning the core mechanisms of EVE and not knowing in where and what can kill you might cause extre pressure on your yet so small but ever growing wallet.

The coalition offers a Ship Replacement program that is designed to help our new members in the situations where they have lost their bellowed ships. It also aims to teach you how to use SRP systems so that once you advance in your career and take part in fleets that offer 100% coverage on your losses you know how to get your money back.

## What does SRP mean
SRP means that the coalition (or whoever is providing the SRP) will pay you back money based on the value of your lost ship. SRP is used differently in different situations. In most null sec fleets your losses are covered 100% while flying solo most often no one will cover your loss. Its important to know where and when you are entitled to ask for the SRP

## How to know the SRP status
If you take part in a fleet the SRP level is often determined either by the general rules of the hosting party (alliance level SRP policy) or mentioned in the MOTD of the fleet you are taking part.

> SRP status will be told to you for each fleet.

## How to apply for SRP
If  you are in a fleet that has SRP coverage you can apply for SRP if you lose your ship.

1. Lose a doctrine ship
1. Go to our AUTH system and open the SRP section. This section includes all different SRP links that are currently available.
1. Look for the SRP link for your fleet. If you are still in the fleet it is likely that the FC will post the link directly in the chat.
1. Click on the Fleet SRP code. This will open a new window where you will enter the details for your loss.
1. Go to Zkillboard (a site that hosts your kills and losses) at https://zkillboard.com and search for yourself and find your loss.
1. Open the loss and copy the URL of the loss to the SRP program zKillboard column.
1. Fill in what happened in the additional info section. This field highly determines whatever you are going to be paid back or not for your loss.
