<h2><a href="/services/guides/clones">Clones</a></h2>
<p>Jump clones are pods that you can leave in stations around New Eden. You are able to jump from your current location to an installed jump clone location anywhere in known space. This allows you to rapidly change your location. Jump cloning will only move your character to the jump clone location, you will need to move all assets the traditional way.</p>
<h2><a href="/services/guides/overview">Overview Setup</a></h2>
<p>In order to survive in EVE you will need to know where and who your enemies are. The default overview settings work for starters but as soon as you advance into areas where you will be engaging other players it will no longer be sufficient.</p>
