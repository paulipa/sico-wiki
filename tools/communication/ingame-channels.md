# SC Comms | Primary channel
**All of the corporations that belongs to SiCO are using the custom in-game channel called `SC Comms` for all of their general chattering.** The Message Of The Day (MOTD) of this channel also includes everything that you need to know about ongoing events such as wars or upcoming coalition events. The different corporations may be using their own chat channels for sensitive information such as null sec events but all of the general chattering should be kept in SC Comms.

The channel is accessible by all characters that are inside one of the coalition corporations. If you wish to join this channel with an out of coalition alt you need to poke a director. Note that all characters in this channel needs to be registered in our auth system.

Reason for having this global channel in-game is to keep all of our corporations and players together without the need of creating and alliance and using the alliance chat. It also allows our members to join the channel with neutral alts which makes it easier for haulers to coordinate with our members.

> You should always read the MOTD when you log in to the game to make sure you are up to date with the latest events.

## Accessing SC Comms
You can access the SC Comms by either using one of the links you can find in your Corp chat window or by using the channel window and joining it manually by typing in the name of the channel and pressing join.

## Chat rules
As SC Comms is the largest ingame channel for our coalition it will include players with different political alignments and ideologies. As we are all in here to enjoy the game and some of the real life topics may heat the chat up we have banned a few topics from discussion.

> Please refer to the [coalition rules](/community/rules) for chat channels.
