# Pathfinder
Pathfinder is a third-party wormhole mapping tool. It allows thetracking of wormhole connections and chains created of multiplewormholes. It draws a visual map of each wormhole that the players havescanned and added to the system allowing easy movement between wormholespace and known space.

## Setting up
Setting up Pathfinder is extremely simple. All you need to do is navigate to https://pathfinder.silentcoalition.com and log in with a character, that you are going to use for mapping (exploration).

> The character you log in must be in SICO corporations as the mapper only allows our coalition members to use it.
{.is-warning}

Right after you have logged in you will be able to see the different maps such as WH HQ, PI Land and SICO GLOBAL that will be used for all mappings. These maps are shared with all the SiCO corporations and all members in the coalition can take advantage of it.

You should always use the correct map that corresponds to your current location. If you are scanning in our wormhole HQ system J105348 you should use the map that says J105348 not to cluster up maps with all different wormholes.

For non default locations you can either use the sico global map that is shared to all coalition members or create a new one for your own corporation (not guided how to do this).

# Using Pathtinder
The core functions in pathfinder are very easy to use. If you want tohave a look at the manual for all of the functions you may open the integrated manual by pressing the map button on the top right corner.

## Adding signatures
If there has not been any wormholes or signatures scanned out your map will only show the HQ locations that we have pinned down in the map. If you are scanning from inside out you will see yourself in one of these locations. 

`The green marker` tells you the name of other active mappers in your system. Your name is displayed in the active system.

Click on your active system to select it and to make it active. You now have more options visible for the selected system.

To add all signatures from your current system to pathfinder simply:

- Open your probe launcher
- Select all signatures by pressing Ctrl + A
- Copy all signatures with Ctrl + C
- Paste the clipboard to the pathfinder page by clicking anywhere on the site and pressing Ctrl + V

See the gif: [Copying signatures from game to pathfinder](/pathfinder6.mp4)

## Scanning signatures

Next you want to start scanning down the signatures one by one. While scanning you can repeat the previous step for signatures that you have partially scanned but do not intend to scan down completely. Like data sites you do not intend to run. This way other players using pathfinder will know what the signature is.

See the gif: [Scanning signatures](/scanning-signatures.mp4)

If you have completely scanned down a signature you can add all the information about it by again just copy pasting it on pathfinder. This is very usefull when scanning down data, relic and gas sites. For wormholes you won’t get much information from the probe window.

See the gif: [Copying scanned signatures](/pathfinder_9.mp4)

After you have scanned down a wormhole you can warp next to it. Now we will add the missing information to the pathfinder signature we just scanned. In this case id NUR

Show the information of the wormhole you just scanned down. The important things we are looking at are the wormhole type (in this case C247), lifetime and mass left. Click on the wormhole signature on pathfinder and fill in or select the information to match the ingame window.

See the gif: [Adding wormhole information](/wormhole-information.mp4)

As we have not yet went thorough the hole we can’t know where it leads to so this will be left blank. However we now know the type of the system the wormhole leads so we can bookmark it as NUR -> C3

Keep scanning until you have scanned down and marked all sites on pathfinder. After this we will take the wormholes and start forming the chain.

## Wormhole chains and new wormholes

When you take a wormhole pathfinder will automatically add the chain to it if you have tracking enabled (which you should if you didnt change your settings). If pathfinder can’t determine the correct connection it will ask you to fix it.

See the gif: [Automatic tracking](/wormhole-information.mp4)

Now that we are in a new wormhole we will just repeat what we did earlier. Click on your current system to make it active and paste all signatures in it.

See gif: [Signatures in new hole](/signatures_in_adjecent_hole.mp4)

What we want to do first is to determine which ID led to the system we just came from. In this case which one leads to J105348. Do a fast scan on top of yourself and you will get the closest signature. Now select this signature on pathfinder and add the information required as shown in the video bellow. All previously scanned wormholes will be now visible in the leads to drop down so they are easy to add.

See gif: [Change Pathfinder wormholes class](/change-pathfinder-wormhole_class.mp4)

Keep on scanning down all of the signatures and copy pasting them in to pathfinder. Don’t remember to bookmark the hole you came from! Once you enter the next wormholes pathfinder will keep on drawing the map for you.

When you reach you reach your destination you are all set! Most often you are looking for exits to known space. When you click on the known space system you found you will get basic information about it, including amount of jumps to predetermined systems like jita and coalition HQ.
![pathfinder6-1400x376.jpg](/pathfinder6-1400x376.jpg =500x)

You have now found and created your first wormhole chain from our HQ to a known space system!

## Deleting signatures
Signatures will vanish over time. Pathfinder will also remove them once their maximum lifetime has been reached. However in events of wormhole rolling, lately scanned sites or if you are running the anomalie sites they may be gone before the program deletes them.

To delete vanished signatures simply copy and paste all signatures to the program and use the “lazy delete signatures” option. It is not recommended to activate this option on the dashboard. Instead use the signature reader and activate the option in here. This way you do not delete signatures by mistake if you filter them out.

See the gif: [Deleting signatures](/deleting-signatures.mp4)

If you only have a few signatures to delete the easiest way is to press the deletebutton next to the signature.
