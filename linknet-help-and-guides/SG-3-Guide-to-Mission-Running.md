This is Spectral Guide 3 - Guide to Mission Running

Mission running is deceptively simplistic, however there is in fact much depth and knowledge involved in becoming good at running missions in Eve online.

---
The corporation I recommend you run missions for is Ministry of Internal Order as this is the corporation you will need 5.0 standing with to be qualified to run the level 4 Amarr epic arc further on in your mission running career.

The nearest agents of this corporation to HQ (Ronne) with safe highsec routes are 

Level 1: Shasha Hifa at Sasoutikh VI - Moon 3 - Ministry of Internal Order Logistic Support 

Level 2:  Anayoud Hehyoorath at Gheth VIII - Moon 8 - Ministry of Internal Order Logistic Support 

Level 3:  Dasa Pure at Mehatoor I - Ministry of Internal Order Logistic Support 

Level 4:  Edami Dantan at Penirgman IX - Moon 3 - Ministry of Internal Order Assembly Plant

In honesty, level 1 missions don't pose much of a challenge at all and can be easily completed even in a poorly fitted ship, so I'm not going to dwell too much on this.

Mission running can be problematic for you in level 2 missions if you are not in a properly fitted ship - see SG-4 on recommended basic mission running fits.

This career begins to become challenging at level 3 and 4 where it is realistically no longer viable to simply go into the missions with any random ship and fit and expect to be able to run them consistently or within a reasonable timeframe.

You not only need a properly fitted ship and adequate skills, but also an understanding of how damage types and resistance works in Eve online.

---
You see; different weapons load different ammo which deal different types of damage out of the four options of damage types (EM, Thermal, Kinetic and Explosive).

Different rats (pi-rat-es, get it? :P) deal different proportions of these damage types and are also weaker to certain damage types than others.

It becomes important to keep this in mind as you run your missions, as if you warp into a mission site where the rats shoot kinetic damage to you but your ships resistance modules are geared for explosive - this is going to be problematic for you as the explosive resistance is completely useless against the incoming kinetic damage.

---
A very good website to look up what kind of damage you will face and also what kind of damage you should aim to shoot is https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=missionreports.

You can look up your mission, lets take https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=AngelExtragavanza4 as one example.

You can see from the information "Damage dealt: Explosive/Kinetic", and "Recommended damage dealing: Explosive/Kinetic".

This tells me that the rats in this particular mission will shoot explosive and kinetic damage at me, but they are also weak against explosive and kinetic damage, so I should change my ships resistance modules to fight against explosive and kinetic - and if at all possible load explosive or kinetic damage to shoot against them.

running level 3 missions.  You can see in the low slots I have an Experimental Enduring Kinetic Armor Hardener I and an Experimental Enduring Thermal Armor Hardener I.

What I also have in my cargohold however is the other two variations of armor hardener (the EM and explosive variants) so that I can swap out those specific resistance hardeners for specific resistance against the particular mission I'm running.

You can also see the Hornet I's and Vespa I's deal kinetic damage (found in the attributes tab at the bottom).  If I am fighting against an NPC who is weak to EM however, I may consider swapping to the Amarr drones (Acolyte I and Infiltrator I).  As a side note, the Warden I's in that fit are drones you do not want to swap out as they are there for the purpose of being long range sniper drones, but this is another topic.

It's very important to check out the damage types used in missions for every mission and swap out your hardeners for each mission (particularlly in level 3 and 4).

To improve the pay you get from mission running, you can train Negotiation to get a 5% increase in payment per level and Security Connections to get a 10% LP (Loyalty Point) increase in payment per level.

You can also train Connections to increase your standing with NPC corporations so you can move on to higher level missions faster.
