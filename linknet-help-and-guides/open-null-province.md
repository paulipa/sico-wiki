# LinkNet Open Null Province [ONP]
Our community offers an open null sec constellation where any community partner member* may play and experience null sec gameplay without the initial need of commiting to a null sec corporation. New corporations joining the community partner program will be vetted before granted access. This space is here to offer you a low barrier entry to trial our null sec life. As no corporation change is needed to enter this space you can always easily return back to high sec if things do not work out for you in null.

> If you decide to live more permanently in our ONP area you are to then move to one of our corporations inside our null sec alliance or to explore the options of our other null sec based corporations.
{.is-success}

We currently habit the constellation area in Providence. The systems owned by the LinkNet alliance [LINE] are open for your business.

## Rules while operating in ONP
The rules for operating in this area are pretty much similar to our other areas with a few exceptions.

Staging station is `S9X-AX - Happy Birthday Sierra`, use it as your base of operations

All [community partners](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/partner-corporations) that have been vetted are allowed to enter the area. Neutral partners with their own risk. According to our rules neutral partners will not sit in null to camp our own members. Neutral partners are not expected to spend great amount of time in the area.

SEADC members who try out life in Provi are expected to move over to the null corps within 1-2 weeks. Silent Vale & Silent Amethyst are current corporations offering home for permanent provi pilots. These corporations have also extra blues from the next door alliances and are more safe against random ganks compared to other linknet community corporations.

> Service taxes are intentianlly increased for non null sec alliance corporations such as SEADC and SLTRN to discourage you to sit in the entry corporation if you permanently live in ONP. Moving to the proper null corporation will decrease your taxes and costs.

# Handbook
This section will explain to you how to use null sec related tools and ingame services.

## Welcome ship
To celebrate the launch of our new province we are offering free welcome ships at ONP staging station. We currently stock: 
- [Procurers and venturers](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#mining-fleet)
- [Ratting vexors](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#ratting)

To request a ship simply type your character name and the ship you want in the [#requests](https://discord.com/channels/230672980814987264/972946904348508160) channel on our community discord located under the `open-null-province` folder.

The ship will be contracted you as soon as possible.

## Freight to ONP

All contracts are assigned for `LinkNet Freight`

Keep in mind that due to the extremely long route this is not an express shipping service. Collateral is currently not used in this route and the corporation the contracts are assigned to are managed only by Ikarus. In an event off loss of freight we will try to reimbush your loss with our best cababilities.

All the information you will need is given on the freight calculator. Please use the settings given by the calculator when creating your courier contracts.

> Assembled Containers or Plastic Wrap are not allowed in the courier contracts. Item value per contract must be less than 2B isk

## Getting to ONP
The route to ONP is quite long if you are coming from Oisio or Jita. The easiest way to get to our null sec HQ is simply to board a shuttle and start jumping your way to our staging system. If you are in a cheap clone you can autopilot your shuttles all the way down to the last high sec system.

Shuttles are immune to warp bubble and align faster than most tackling ships are able to lock you up. This is why your route to the null staging will most likely go without any issues.

## Intel channel
While you are operating in our ONP you will be using a dedicated channel for player movement intel. To open this channel simply join the `LinkNetNS.Intel` channel that is linked in the null sec chat MOTD.

When you see a new neutral player enter the system you are in simply drag and drop the players name into the interl channel. After the player name drag your system name. If you have visual information about the ship type the neutral is flying you can also type that in after the system name.

## Standing fleet
Standing fleet is used to provide security both for you and fellow players currently online and playing. Staying in the standing fleet will allow faster responses as well as let the Fleet Commanders know an estimated number of active playeres currently in the ONP area. 

Join the standing fleet for ONP via the in-game fleet finder each time you are playing in ONP.
