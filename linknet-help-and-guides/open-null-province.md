# LinkNet Open Null Province [ONP]
Our community offers an open null sec constellation where any blue may play and experience null sec gameplay without the initial need of commiting to a null sec corporation. The space is open for all **blue LinkNet partner corporations**, including the entry level corporation. This space is here to offer you a low barrier entry to trial our null sec life. As no corporation change is needed to enter this space you can always easily return back to high sec if things do not work out for you in null.

You can check your current corporation partnership level by checking your standings towards the LinkNet alliance ingame.

We currently habit the constellation pocket of [RHG-4O](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Feythabolis/RHG-4O#sec). The systems owned by the LinkNet alliance [LINE] are open for your business.

> Only blue partners are able to play in the open province area.

> If you do seem to find out that null sec is your thing we highly recommend that you move to one of our more focused partner corporations located in different regions of null sec space to gain the full null sec experience. A list of our null partners is locted in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/partner-corporations#null-sec).

# Handbook
This section will explain to you how to use null sec related tools and ingame services.

## Welcome ship
To celebrate the launch of our new province we are offering free welcome ships at RIT-A7. We currently stock: 
- [Procurers and venturers](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#mining-fleet)
- [Ratting vexors](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/community/doctrines/coalition-doctrines#ratting)

To request a ship simply type your character name and the ship you want in the [#requests](https://discord.com/channels/230672980814987264/972946904348508160) channel on our community discord located under the `open-null-province` folder.

The ship will be contracted you as soon as possible.

## Freight to Feythabolis
You can use our freight service to ship items to Feythabolis. The freight calculator is located at https://auth.eve-linknet.com/freight/calculator

All contracts are assigned for `LinkNet Freight`
![linknet_freight.png](/linknet_freight.png)

Keep in mind that due to the extremely long route this is not an express shipping service. Collateral is currently not used in this route and the corporation the contracts are assigned to are managed only by trusted players. In an event off loss of freight we will try to reimbush your loss with our best cababilities.

All the information you will need is given on the freight calculator. Please use the settings given by the calculator when creating your courier contracts.

> Assembled Containers or Plastic Wrap are not allowed in the courier contracts

## Getting to Feythabolis
The route to Fay is quite long if you are coming from Oisio or Jita. The easiest way to get to our null sec HQ is simply to board a shuttle and start jumping your way to our staging system. If you are in a cheap clone you can autopilot your shuttles all the way down to the last high sec system.

Shuttles are immune to warp bubble and align faster than most tackling ships are able to lock you up. This is why your route to the null staging will most likely go without any issues.

## Intel channel
While you are operating in our ONP you will be using a dedicated channel for player movement intel. To open this channel simply join the `LinkNetFeyth.Intel` channel that is linked in the null sec chat MOTD.

When you see a new neutral player enter the system you are in simply drag and drop the players name into the interl channel. After the player name drag your system name. If you have visual information about the ship type the neutral is flying you can also type that in after the system name.
