# LinkNet Open Null Province [ONP]
Our community offers an open null sec constellation where any blue may play and experience null sec gameplay without the initial need of commiting to a null sec corporation. The space is open for all **blue LinkNet partner corporations**, including the entry level corporation. This space is here to offer you a low barrier entry to trial our null sec life.

You can check your current corporation partnership level by checking your standings towards the LinkNet alliance ingame.

We currently habit the constellation pocket of [RHG-4O](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Feythabolis/RHG-4O#sec). The systems owned by the LinkNet alliance [LINE] are open for your business.

> Only blue partners are able to play in the open province area.

> If you do seem to find out that null sec is your thing we highly recommend that you move to one of our more focused partner corporations located in different regions of null sec space to gain the full null sec experience. A list of our null partners is locted in [here](https://wiki.eve-linknet.com/en/community/partner-corporations#null-sec).

## Freight to Feythabolis
You can use our freight service to ship items to Feythabolis. The freight calculator is located at https://auth.eve-linknet.com/freight/calculator

All contracts are assigned for `LinkNet Freight`
![linknet_freight.png](/linknet_freight.png)

Keep in mind that due to the extremely long route this is not an express shipping service. Collateral is currently not used in this route and the corporation the contracts are assigned to are managed only by trusted players. In an event off loss of freight we will try to reimbush your loss with our best cababilities.

All the information you will need is given on the freight calculator. Please use the settings given by the calculator when creating your courier contracts.

> Assembled Containers or Plastic Wrap are not allowed in the courier contracts
