# LinkNet Open Null Province [ONP]
Our community offers an open null sec constellation where any blue may play and experience null sec gameplay without the initial need of commiting to a null sec corporation. The space is open for all **blue LinkNet partner corporations**, including the entry level corporation.

You can check your current corporation partnership level by checking your standings towards the LinkNet alliance ingame.

We currently habit the constellation pocket of [RHG-4O](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Feythabolis/RHG-4O#sec). The systems owned by the LinkNet alliance [LINE] are open for your business.

> Only blue partners are able to play in the open province area.
