The guides Spectral have to offer are also delivered in the form of mailing lists.  To join a mailing list - open up your mail in-game, then at the bottom left click "Add Mailing List" and enter the name of the guide you wish to access.

For example, entering "SG-3" would have you join the Guide to Mission Running.

Of course you may also find them below.
