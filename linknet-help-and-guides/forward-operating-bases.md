Forward Operating Base is an special type event that may happen in any random high sec system. You will be able to locate active FOB systems via the agency->encounters menu. You can only see the events in your current region.

> Forward Operating Bases will spawn NPC pirates in the active system. The pirats will attack you similar to normal roaming NPC rats. However They are often fitted with warp scramblers making them extremely deadly against vulnerable targets such as miners.
