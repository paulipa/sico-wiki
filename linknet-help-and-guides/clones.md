# Jump Clones
Jump clones are pods that you can leave in stations around New Eden. You are able to jump from your current location to an installed jump clone location anywhere in known space. This allows you to rapidly change your location. Jump cloning will only move your character to the jump clone location, you will need to move all assets the traditional way.
## Requirements
There are certain requirements for using jump clones.
-	You will need the skill Infomorph Psychology trained to at least level 1. Each level of this skill will allow you to install one additional clone in a new station
-	You will need 100,000 ISK to pay for a jump clone when we reach our destination.
## Limitations
Jump clones are a fast way for you to change your location. However there are some limitations to this:
-	You can only jump clone travel within known space. There is no way to jump clone to a wormhole system from the outside.
-	In order to install a jump clone to a station the station must have a clone bay service installed.
-	You can’t jump clone to an upwell structure if the clone bay service is offline even if you have a jump clone installed in the structure.
-	Each jump clone jump that has not been done within a single station (swapping  clones) has a 24 hour cooldown. This can be reduced with the skill Infomorph Synchronizing down to 19 hours.
-	You can only have one jump clone installed in a station at any given time.
## Installing jump clones
1. Find a station with a clone bay service. You can see the services for each station from the services tab of the station information panel.
2. Fly to the station
3. Open the clone bay service
4. On the bottom row in the jump clone section select install clone
## Jumping to a jump clone

You can always jump to a jump clone from any NPC station regardless of If it has a clone bay service or not. However you are unable to jump to a jump clone from an upwell structure if the structure doesn’t have a clone bay service online!
When you jump to a jump clone you always leave your old clone behind to the station you left from.
1. After you have installed a jump clone you are able to jump to it. 
2. Open your character sheet window and go to the character->jump clones tab
3. Select the jump clone you want to jump to and press jump
4. You will be instantly transferred to the clone you jumped to and leave a clone behind you in the station you jumped from.

### Example
1. You have a jump clone located in null sec space in station Sakht VI - Moon 7 - Genolution Biotech Production.
2. You are located at Jita 4-4 station.
3. Your clone in Sakht has no implants
4. Your current clone in Jita 4-4 has full training implant set
5. You click on jump to Sakht clone
6. You are now located at Sakht
7. You no longer have a jump clone installed in Sakht (you took that in active use)
8. You now have a jump clone installed in Jita 4-4 with training implants (the clone you left behind)
# Applications
There are multiple applications for jump clones and multiple ways to use them.
## Traditional jump cloning
The traditional usage for jump cloning is to jump from station A to B and play in that area until your jump clone cooldown is over. Then you can jump back to station A from station B.
Downside of the traditional jump cloning is that you will need to wait 24 hours in between changing locations. This is not beneficial if you are looking to jump clone for the location B just to join one operation.
## Jump cloning and death cloning
Jump clones and death clones are two different things. Death clone location is the location where you will end up when your pod is destroyed. By combining jump clones and death clones it is possible for you to jump clone from station A to B and return back to station A without waiting the 24 hour cooldown.
Using death clones requires you to use clones without any implants as you would lose the implants during the destruction of the clones.
1. Install an empty jump clone to a station you frequently plan to visit
2. Dock up in a station A you want to depart from.
3. Set your medical clone aka. death clone to the station by setting the station as your home station
4. Jump to the destination station B jump clone
5. Destroy the jump clone you left in station A you departed from from your character jump clone tab.
6. Install a new jump clone in station B (the station you are in)
7. After you want to return back to station A destroy your pod.
8. After your pod as died you will respawn in station A where you set your medical clone
9. You now are back at the original location and can repeat the clone trip in 24 hours.
## Changing clones within a single citadel

If you have a clone with expensive implants and you are looking to do something that might risk losing them you want to change to an empty clone.
Changing clones within a single upwell structure does not trigger the 24 hour cooldown
1. Go to an upwell structure with a clone bay service
2. Install an empty jump clone
3. Click to jump to the clone you just installed
4. Your clone with implants is now stored in the station and you are in the empty clone
5. To swap back to the clone with implants simply jump clone to it from within the same station.
